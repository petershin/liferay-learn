# Adding Field Validations

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2023.Q3+/GA92+`

Validations set rules for determining valid field entries. Each validation has its own trigger, conditions, and error message, which you can set via the Objects UI. You can define validations using [Groovy scripts](#using-groovy-validations) or [Liferay expressions](#using-expression-builder-validations).

A third type of validation is available as of Liferay DXP 2024.Q1+/GA112+: [Composite Key validation](#using-composite-key-validations). Use composite key validations to require that a combination of two or more fields be unique.

![Create validations for custom and system object fields.](./adding-field-validations/images/01.png)

!!! note
    - If out-of-the-box validations don't meet your needs, you can create custom validations using the `objectValidationRule` client extension. See [Microservice Client Extensions](../../../integrating-microservices.md) for more information.
    - Validation messages for system objects may not be displayed in their native UI. However, the validations run as expected.

To add a validation,

1. Open the *Global Menu* ( ![Global Menu](../../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png) ), go to the *Control Panel* tab, and click *Objects*.

1. Begin editing an object definition.

1. Go to the *Validations* tab and click *Add* ( ![Add Button](../../../../images/icon-add.png) ).

1. Enter a *label* and select a validation type: *Groovy*, *Expression Builder*, or *Composite Key*.

   If you've deployed object validation rule client extensions to your instance, they also appear as options.

   ![Enter a label and select a validation type.](./adding-field-validations/images/02.png)

1. Click *Save*.

1. Begin editing the validation.

1. In the Basic Info tab, activate the validation.

   ![Activate the validation.](./adding-field-validations/images/03.png)

1. Select the *trigger event* to determine when the validation runs.

   Each validation can only have one trigger event.

1. Add validation rules. 

   For Groovy and Expression Builder validations, go to the *Conditions* tab and add conditions to the validation.

   Conditions can include multiple fields and functions for performing complex logic.

   ![Add conditions to the validation.](./adding-field-validations/images/04.png)

   When using Groovy, you can browse and add available data fields to your conditions via the side panel. See [Using Groovy Validations](#using-groovy-validations) for more information.

   When using Expression Builder, you can browse and add fields, operators, and functions to your conditions via the side panel. See [Using Expression Builder Validations](#using-expression-builder-validations) for more information.

   !!! important
       * Groovy script validations are only available for Liferay PaaS and Liferay DXP Self-Hosted.
       * As of DXP 2024.Q3, scripting is disabled by default. You can enable it in System Settings &rarr; Script Management (under the Security category).

   To set up composite key validations, go to the *Unique Composite Key* tab and select the fields to use as a composite key. See [Using Composite Key Validations](#using-composite-key-validations) for more information.

   ![Choose the fields to use as a composite key.](./adding-field-validations/images/09.png)

1. Enter a localizable *error message*. This message appears whenever the validation is triggered, and field entries do not meet one or more of the defined conditions.

1. Select an output validation type to determine where the error message appears.

   **Full Validation (Form Summary)**: Display the error message at the top of the form.

   **Partial Validation (Inline Field)**: Display the error message next to the specified field.

   ![Enter an error message and select an output validation type.](./adding-field-validations/images/05.png)

1. Click *Save*.

While activated, the validation runs for all new object entries and is displayed in [layouts](../layouts.md) and [form containers](../../using-fragments-to-build-forms.md)

![Validations are displayed in form containers.](./adding-field-validations/images/06.png)

## Using Groovy Validations

{bdg-primary}`Liferay PaaS and Liferay DXP Self-Hosted`

!!! important
    As of DXP 2024.Q3, scripting is disabled by default. You can enable it in System Settings &rarr; Script Management (under the Security category).

Groovy validations support all standard [Groovy Script](https://groovy-lang.org/) capabilities. When defining conditions, you must use the `invalidFields` variable. Liferay only displays the validation error message when `invalidFields` returns `true`.

![Use the side panel to add field elements to your Groovy validations.](./adding-field-validations/images/07.png)

Liferay uses the [GroovyShell class](https://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/lang/GroovyShell.html) to check your Groovy scripts for valid syntax when you click *Save*. If the script is invalid, Liferay shows an error message.

## Using Expression Builder Validations

Expression Builder provides predefined fields, operators, and functions that you can access in the Elements side panel. Clicking an element adds it to the conditions editor. These functions return a Boolean value. See [Expression Builder Validations Reference](./expression-builder-validations-reference.md) for a complete list of provided operators and functions.

!!! important
    You can only use Expression Builder validations with text, numeric, date, and Boolean field types.

![Use the side panel to add field, operator, and function elements to your validation.](./adding-field-validations/images/08.png)

Liferay checks your expression for valid syntax when you click Save. If the expression is invalid, Liferay shows an error message.

## Available Fields Reference

When constructing conditions, you can use any of the object's custom or system fields. You can also select from relationship fields on the child side of a one-to-many relationship.

Below are all default fields available for custom objects:

| Field                   | Description                                    |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `companyId`             | Portal instance where the entry was created    |
| `createDate`            | When the entry was created                     |
| `currentDate`           | Date when the entry is submitted               |
| `currentUserId`         | ID of the user submitting the entry            |
| `externalReferenceCode` | External reference code for the entry          |
| `groupId`               | Site ID in where the entry was created         |
| `lastPublishDate`       | Date when the entry was last published         |
| `modifiedDate`          | Date when the entry was last modified          |
| `mvccVersion`           | MVCC version of the entry                      |
| `objectDefinitionId`    | ID of the entry's object                       |
| `objectEntryId`         | ID for the entry                               |
| `status`                | Workflow status for the entry                  |
| `statusByUserId`        | ID of the assigned user in Workflow            |
| `statusByUserName`      | Name of the assigned user in Workflow          |
| `statusDate`            | Date when the Workflow status was last updated |
| `userId`                | ID of the entry's author                       |
| `userName`              | User name of the entry's author                |
| `uuid`                  | Unique universal ID for the entry              |

System objects have their own default fields, though there is some overlap with the above chart.

## Using Composite Key Validations

{bdg-link-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q1+/GA112+ ([Release Feature Flag](../../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#release-feature-flags))`

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q3+/GA125+ (Generally Available)`

If your version of Liferay requires it, first enable the release feature flag for composite key validation. Go to *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; *Control Panel* &rarr; *Instance Settings* &rarr; *Feature Flags*. Open the *Release* section and enable *Improve Field Validations (LPS-187854)*.

Some data models and applications require unique composite keys. For example, an orders object can require that each combination of customer ID and order date are unique in the system. Once enforced, this composite key can be used to look up and work with unique order entries. The Unique Composite Key validation ensures that a combination of fields is unique in the scope of the object. Site-scoped objects can have unique composite keys in the site, while instance-scoped objects can have unique composite keys throughout the instance.

You can use text, integer, and picklist fields in composite keys. You can also use relationship fields on the child side of a one-to-many relationship.

![You can use relationship fields in composite keys.](./adding-field-validations/images/10.png)

You cannot add a field to a composite key if it already has data.

![Fields with published data cannot be used in composite keys.](./adding-field-validations/images/11.png)

Certain actions are only supported in draft objects:

| Action                                           | Object Status          | Supported                |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delete the validation                            | Draft<br><br>Published | &#10004;<br><br>&#10004; |
| Remove a field from the validation               | Draft<br><br>Published | &#10004;<br><br>&#10008; |
| Delete a field that's being used in a validation | Draft<br><br>Published | &#10008;<br><br>&#10008; |
