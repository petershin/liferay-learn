# What is a Digital Experience Platform

Digital Experience Platforms emerged with the convergence of Content Management, Digital Commerce, and Horizontal Portal technologies. While defined differently by different analysts, the broad definition is very similar.

Gartner defines a DXP as

> “A digital experience platform (DXP) is an integrated and cohesive piece of technology designed to enable the composition, management, delivery and optimization of contextualized digital experiences across multi-experience customer journeys.”

While Forrester, who were the first to call out Digital Experience Platforms distinctly from other offerings define a DXP as

> “Forrester distills a digital experience down to four solutions: 1) understanding the customer with data; 2) creating the experience with content; 3) tailoring that experience to fit the context with marketing; and 4) delivering value with commerce.“

Liferay defines a DXP as follows:

> “Enterprise software that provides the foundation for companies to deliver connected, contextualized digital experiences across multiple touchpoints for the entire customer journey.
> Put simply, a DXP is a single platform that has all the elements to deliver external and internal digital experiences.”

## Liferay Portal Heritage

Portal solutions focus on the needs of the long-term relationship between organizations and their customers, employees, partners, suppliers, and so on.

A key differentiator of DXPs with portal heritage is the support for these needs through capabilities like authenticated experiences, and a focus on integration between the DXP and other systems.

Gartner has frequently recognized this in Liferay. For example in 2022, Gartner said

> “Liferay targets enterprise IT buyers with its powerful tooling and pure-play portal heritage.”

On top of it, Liferay has also searched ways to innovate by going beyond DXP, the result of which being the addition of CMS, Commerce, and Low-Code capabilities.

## Anatomy of a Digital Experience Platform

The basic anatomy of a Digital Experience Platform could be described as follows:

* First are the Digital Touchpoints where our Customers interact with their users---their customers, employees, citizens, businesses, partners, etc. These are the experiences that an end user has as they interact with the company which might be web, mobile, ChatBot, kiosk, IoT etc.
* These touchpoints then provide some sort of presentation layer---which may be supplied by the platform itself, or implemented via headless API capabilities. Liferay’s presentation layer is flexible enough to support all and any of these types of presentation technologies.
* These interfaces serve information and data sourced from various enterprise data sources or content authoring systems. These disparate data sources include CRM, ERP, HRIS, Marketing Automation tools, and many others.
* The DXP therefore must include some sort of integration layer---which might be native to the platform or some 3rd party tool like an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)

The heart of a DXP, however, sits between the presentation and integration layers. This is the promise of a DXP's transformative power for a customer's business.

That promise is Contextual Delivery: delivering the right content to the right person at the right time in the right context.

Contextual delivery includes things like content management and authoring, web experience, analytics, personalization and segmentation, digital asset management, forms and workflow, digital commerce, no-code/low-code application building capabilities, easily deployed theming, and more.

## Solutions Across the Entire Customer Journey

Another way to look at what a DXP should provide is to look at the customer life cycle.  Typically this starts well before a customer becomes a customer, continues through engaging with the customer, converting them, and then retaining them by serving them well and growing them.
