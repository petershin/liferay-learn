Geolocated assets include geographical data, allowing them to be displayed on maps or filtered based on location. You can use geolocation data to display a list of local events, nearby facilities, or region-specific news articles.

To enable geolocation for assets,

<!-- This article could use an introductory paragraph that answers: what geolocated assets are - IDEALLY we present a screenshot of an asset being displayed in liferay that shows geolocation data included. This gives the reader a sense of what this article is helping them accomplish. -->

<!-- I tested it but I couldn't make it work. So, I still can't show an image of it working. I just updated the page for now. Eric. -->
