# Building Enterprise Websites with Liferay

In today's digital market, businesses need to provide users with engaging, personalized online experiences that distinguish their brand and drive conversions. However, web design systems can be overly complex and require extensive technical knowledge to implement designs and custom solutions. Furthermore, without a unified platform, tools and systems can quickly proliferate, leading to data silos, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and integration challenges.

Liferay DXP provides a comprehensive environment for business teams and developers to efficiently build enterprise websites at scale. With low-code capabilities and a user-friendly editor, Liferay's flexible platform simplifies and optimizes site development. You can also leverage Liferay to unify your technical infrastructure and enable seamless integration with existing systems.
