# Changing Site Membership Type

A site's membership type determines how freely users may join your site. There are three types of site membership:

- **Open:** Users can join and leave whenever they want. The site is visible to all users in the My Sites app.

- **Restricted:** Site is visible in the My Sites application, and users must request membership to join.

- **Private:** A site administrator must explicitly invite users to join and then add them to the site. Private membership sites don't appear in the My Sites app.

## Setting Site Membership Type

      1. From the Site Menu, go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Site Settings*.
