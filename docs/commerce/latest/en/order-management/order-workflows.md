# Order Workflows

Order workflows are a channel-specific setting. If enabled, it requires the buyer or seller to give internal prior [approval](./approving-or-rejecting-orders-in-order-workflows.md) before [processing](./orders/processing-an-order.md) an order. To learn more about Liferay workflows in general, see [Introduction to Workflow](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/process-automation/workflow/introduction-to-workflow).

![Order workflows are an integral part of commerce.](./order-workflows/images/01.png)

You can activate the _Buyer Order Approval Workflow_, _Seller Order Acceptance Workflow_, or both in your order lifecycle. The workflows, when enabled, mirror real world business procedures, such as all orders being reviewed by an order manager before submission.
