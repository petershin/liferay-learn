# Understanding Interests

As individuals interact with the pages of a Liferay site, Analytics Cloud notes the topics they contain. The more an individual visits pages that contain a topic, the higher the topic's ranking is for that individual's interests.

```{note}
Interests are based on multiple interactions and multiple sessions on a site. Interests data is presented after an individual has interacted with a site a minimum of five times (e.g. page views, page clicks, etc.). A page interaction is defined as an individual interacting with a page for a minimum of five seconds.
```

Interest topics are generated based on a site page's title and description. Therefore, using page titles and descriptions that are well defined will lead to more specific interest topics. You can augment the interest topics by [adding keywords](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/site-building/creating-pages/page-settings/page-settings-ui-reference#seo) to the configuration of a site page.

```{note}
Generated interest topics are only supported in English. Non-English content is filtered out. However, non-English keywords can be added to a page's configuration as a workaround. For example, the Spanish word for sports (i.e. `deportes`) can be added as a keyword. As individuals interact with the page, Analytics Cloud will show `deportes` as an interest topic.
```

Finding out topics people are interested in helps you relate your products and services to them. Analytics Cloud's interests insight empowers you with rich, easy-to-understand visuals that provide this information.

For example, say your site has pages that mention these topics:

* Clothing
* Sports

If an individual named Michael frequents these pages, the interest ranking for the clothing and sports topics is high. Here are a couple of different ways you could use this information:

If you sell sports apparel, you could prepare a campaign for selling sports apparel to Michael.

If you don't sell sports apparel, you could use the interest data to convince sports apparel vendors to advertise on your site.

Either way, the interests insight helps generate new business. The interests insight tells you the most common topics mentioned by the pages and assets customers visit most.
