# Using the UPS Shipping Method

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q3+/Portal 7.4 GA125+`

Liferay provides a client extension that integrates with [UPS](https://www.ups.com/). It uses the shipping engine client extension as a base. See [Configuring Shipping Methods](https://learn.liferay.com/w/commerce/store-management/configuring-shipping-methods) to read more about the shipping methods available out-of-the-box with Liferay.

!!! note
    Currently, the UPS client extension is only compatible with Liferay SaaS.

## Install and Deploy the UPS Client Extension

1. Go to the [Liferay Marketplace](https://marketplace.liferay.com/) and search for `Liferay Commerce Connector to UPS`.

1. Click *Get App*, select your account or create one, and accept the end user license agreement and terms of service.

1. Click *Continue*.

1. Select a project from the ones available to you.

1. Click *Get App*.

1. Note the order ID. You must use it to install the app from your Cloud dashboard.

1. Click *Go to Console*.

1. Go to Services and click *New App*.

1. Enter the order ID from before and complete the installation.

1. Log in as an administrator and verify that the OAuth Application User Agent was added to Liferay. Open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *OAuth2 Administration*. Verify the creation of a new entry called Liferay UPS Commerce Shipping Engine OAuth Application User Agent.

## Verifying the Addition of UPS as a Shipping Method

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Sites*.

1. Add a new Minium site.

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and go to *Commerce* â†’ *Channels*.

1. Select *Minium Portal* and scroll down to the Shipping Methods section. Verify the creation of UPS as a new shipping method here. It is inactive by default.

1. Select the new shipping engine and activate it using the *Active* toggle.

1. Click *Save*. A new *Configuration* tab appears for the shipping method.

   The configuration tab contains an input field. You must add the following few key-value pairs for the shipping method to work correctly.

   ```
   clientId=[CLIENT_ID]
   clientSecret=[CLIENT_SECRET]
   dimensionsUnitOfMeasurementCode=
   packageWeightUnitOfMeasurementCode=
   packagingTypeCode=
   ratingCodes=
   shipperAddressLine1=
   shipperAddressLine2=
   shipperAddressLine3=
   shipperCountryCode=
   shipperPostalCode=
   simpleRateCode=
   ```

   Replace `[CLIENT_ID]` and `[CLIENT_SECRET]` with the appropriate values from your UPS Developer Dashboard. For valid values of other fields, see links below:
