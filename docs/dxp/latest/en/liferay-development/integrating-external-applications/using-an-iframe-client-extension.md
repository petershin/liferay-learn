# Using an IFrame Client Extension

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4+`

IFrame client extensions use Liferay's frontend infrastructure to register external applications as `<iframe>` HTML elements. They're added to Liferay pages as widgets. Unlike other frontend client extensions, IFrames do not provide a static resource.

Start with a client extension from the [sample workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace).


## Prerequisites

To start developing client extensions,

1. Install a [supported version of Java](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-Quarterly-Releases-Compatibility-Matrix).

   !!! note
       Check the [compatibility matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-7-4-Compatibility-Matrix) for supported JDKs, databases, and environments. See [JVM Configuration](../../installation-and-upgrades/reference/jvm-configuration.md) for recommended JVM settings.

1. Download and unzip the sample workspace:

   ```bash
   curl -o com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/content\?r\=liferay-public-releases\&g\=com.liferay.workspace\&a\=com.liferay.sample.workspace\&\v\=LATEST\&p\=zip
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip
   ```

Now you have the tools to deploy your IFrame client extension.

## Specify a URL for the IFrame Client Extension to Load

The `client-extensions/liferay-sample-iframe-1/client-extension.yaml` file defines the IFrame client extension project in the sample workspace:

```yaml
liferay-sample-iframe-1-counter-app:
    name: Counter App
    type: iframe
    url: https://arnab-datta.github.io/counter-app
```

This client extension has the ID `liferay-sample-iframe-1` and contains the key configurations for an IFrame client extension, including the `name`, `type` and the URL of the app to ingest as an IFrame. The [Counter App](https://github.com/arnab-datta/counter-app) running at the example's `url` is a basic React app that simulates adding items to a shopping cart. After deploying the client extension, you can add the app to a page in Liferay as you would any widget.

See the [IFrame YAML configuration reference](./using-an-iframe-client-extension/iframe-yaml-configuration-reference.md) for more information on the available properties.

## Deploy the IFrame Client Extension

!!! note
    To deploy your client extension to Liferay SaaS, use the Liferay Cloud [Command-Line Tool](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool) to run [`lcp deploy`](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool#deploying-to-your-liferay-cloud-environment).

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Next, go to the client extension's folder in the sample workspace and run

```bash
../../gradlew clean deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
```

This builds your client extension and deploys the zip to Liferay's `/deploy` folder.

!!! tip
    To deploy all client extensions in the workspace simultaneously, run the command from the `/client-extensions` folder.

Confirm the deployment in your Liferay instance's console:

```
STARTED liferay-sample-iframe-1_1.0.0 [1592]
```

Now that your client extension is deployed, configure Liferay to use it.

## Add the IFrame Client Extension as a Widget

The IFrame is added to a page as a widget.

1. Click _Edit_ (![Edit](../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) at the top of any page.

1. Add the widget to the page. In the Fragments and Widgets sidebar (![Fragments and Widgets](../../images/icon-plus.png)), click _Widgets_.

1. Find the Client Extensions &rarr; Counter App widget and drag it onto the page. Click _Publish_.

   ![Drag the Counter App onto a page.](./using-an-iframe-client-extension/images/01.png)

Confirm the Counter App is working by adding some items.
