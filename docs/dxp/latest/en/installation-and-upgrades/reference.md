# Reference

When installing Liferay, you must take into consideration the specifics of your environment. These topics help you integrate Liferay into your existing environment and aid in understanding the possible ways of configuring the core infrastructure of your system. When you install a Liferay bundle, the folder you extract it to becomes known as *[Liferay Home](./reference/liferay-home.md)*. In the Liferay Home folder, you can configure the [JVM settings](./reference/jvm-configuration.md), [portal properties](./reference/portal-properties.md), and [system properties](./reference/system-properties.md). Also make sure to configure the [database](./reference/database-configurations.md).
