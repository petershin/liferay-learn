# Managing Content in Content Pages For Liferay 7.3 and Earlier Versions

For Liferay DXP/Portal 7.3, you can review web content deployed using fragments and widgets in the Contents panel (![Contents](../../../../images/icon-list-ul.png)).

1. Edit or create a content page, master page template, page template, or display page template.

1. Open the *Contents* panel (![Contents panel](../../../../images/icon-list-ul.png)) in the sidebar.

  Content used on the page is listed here, along with how many pages it's used on.

  !!! note
      Web content that's displayed in an asset publisher with dynamic selection isn't listed in the contents panel. You must manage this content directly from the web content admin app in the control panel.

1. Open *Actions* (![Actions icon](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the listed content to manage it. These actions are available:

   - *Edit*: Edit the web content.
   - *Permissions*: Update the web content's permissions.
   - *View Usages*: See where the web content is used on the site.
