# Specifications

A specification stores a single piece of product information. This can be the product's dimensions, color, weight, capacity, or any other attribute. These details help customers when comparing similar products.

Specification data consists of groups, labels, and values. This makes it easier to display and maintain them.

| Name                                         | Description                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Specification Group](#specification-groups) | For grouping and organizing similar specification labels (e.g., `dimensions`) |
| [Specification Label](#specification-labels) | For storing a specification value (e.g., `height`)                            |
| [Specification Value](#specification-values) | Product-specific data added to a specification label (e.g., `100 cm`)         |

!!! note
    Specifications defined at the SKU level override specifications defined at the product level. See [Overriding Product Level Information](./overriding-product-level-information.md) for more details.

## Specification Values

Specification groups and labels are scoped to a catalog. After creating them, you can assign it to a product and set values.

1. Open the _Global Menu_ (![Global Menu icon](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to _Commerce_ &rarr; _Products_.

1. Select a product.

1. Scroll down to the _Specifications_ section.

   ![The specifications sub-tab displays the specifications added to a product.](./specifications/images/05.png)

1. Search for an existing specification and click _Select_ to assign it to the product. You can also create a new specification label by typing its name in the search bar and clicking on _Create New_.

   This assigns the new label to the product.

1. To set its value, click on the label or click _Actions_ (![Actions icon](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select _Edit_. Enter values in the form to set a specification value.

   | Field                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
   | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

   | Group                                                       | Assign the label to a group.                                                                                                                                         |
   | {bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q2+/Portal 7.4 GA120+` Key | Default key to identify the specification value uniquely. Use this to display the specification in a display page template using the Product Specification fragment. |
   | Priority                                                    | Establishes the order to display the specification groups with smaller numbers going first.                                                                          |

![Enter values in the form to set a specification value.](./specifications/images/06.png)

!!! important
    The key field for a specification value was released behind a [release feature flag](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags#release-feature-flags) in Liferay DXP 2024.Q2/Portal 7.4 GA120. It was made Generally Available (GA) in 2024.Q3/GA132.

You can also override the specification group that was selected when the label was created. When editing the label to assign a value, you can choose any group from the _Group_ drop-down box. This change applies only to the current product and has no effect on other products that use the same label.
