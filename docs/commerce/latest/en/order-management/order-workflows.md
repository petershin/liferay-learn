# Order Workflows

Order workflows require the buyer or seller to give internal prior [approval](./order-workflows/approving-or-rejecting-orders-in-order-workflows.md) before [processing](./orders/processing-an-order.md) an order for the channel(s) you choose. To learn more about Liferay workflows in general, see [Introduction to Workflow](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/process-automation/workflow/introduction-to-workflow).

![Order workflows are an integral part of commerce.](./order-workflows/images/01.png)

You can activate the _Buyer Order Approval Workflow_, _Seller Order Acceptance Workflow_, or both in your order life cycle. The workflows, when enabled, mirror real world business procedures, such as all orders being reviewed by an order manager before submission.
