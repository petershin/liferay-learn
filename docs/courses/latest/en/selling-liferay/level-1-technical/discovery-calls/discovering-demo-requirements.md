# Discovery Calls - Demo Discovery

**At a Glance**

* Discovery Calls are used to
  * Qualify and perform basic discovery
  * Discover what might be needed to be shown in a subsequent demo
* Sales Engineers should be involved in both phases
* Demo discovery focuses on understanding the
  * Audience
  * Personas
  * Requirements
  * UX & User Journey mapping
  * Technology Stack
  * Current System
  * Sizing

## Discovering Demo Requirements

Determining the demo requirements is a team effort. Everyone involved in identifying an opportunity, qualifying the opportunity or otherwise working on it should play a part. BDRs, SDRs, Account Managers, and Account Executives all give the Sales Engineer input into what is required in the demo. It is important therefore to not work alone, or in silos, but as a team, from the very start.

Next is learning the right questions to ask so that the prospect shares details about the requirements, which in turn will help to build or tailor a demo to best meet those requirements.

Primarily the following needs to be established: 

* Audience - who will be on the call and what are their roles/titles?
* Personas
* Requirements
* UX, User Journey mapping
* Technology Stack
* Current System
* Sizing

### Audience

Probably the most important aspect of preparing for the demo is to determine who is going to be attending it, because knowing who will be listening determines a lot of what is going to be presented.

Once it is known who is attending, the next step is to understand their roles, and job titles, and their responsibilities within the project itself.

### Personas

Knowing the audience helps prepare the next step, the demo Personas. If the demo includes personas that are aligned to the audience listening, it creates a great impact and makes the demo more relatable. 

Also, the business requirement needs to be referenced as well, for example, if the requirement is for an intranet use-case, the demo should not contain personas such as customers, agents etc.

### Requirements

Focus more on the business outcome and less on the implementation details. As the opportunity progresses there will be many opportunities to discuss what the implementation will eventually look like, but at this stage it is about building confidence that Liferay is the right choice, so focus on how Liferay maps to the requirement either through out-of-the-box features or with customization.

### UX, User Journey mapping

Understanding the audience, the personas and the requirements then helps to create the user journeys that are needed for the demo along with an appealing user experience. The later sessions in this learning path are heavily focused on helping to build appealing and relatable user experiences.

Liferay is a vast platform and without having the user journey, user experience, and demo script defined for the demo, makes it easy to get confused and lost while talking about certain features of the platform. Having these helps the demo to stay aligned to the requirements and also helps to make the best use of the time provided.

### Technology Stack

As mentioned during the qualification phase, understanding the technology stack is very important, because when the opportunity is already technically and functionally qualified, using this understanding when building the demo helps to provide latitude.

If there’s no preference, then the demo can assume that Liferay is the stack, and then the conversation can revolve around how Liferay can integrate into other systems. If there is a preference this must be addressed, because if it is not answered it could be a deal breaker. For example, the prospect might be concerned about how introducing a new technology like Liferay into an existing stack might actually work, and if the Sales Engineer does not address this their confidence that Liferay can be the right solution may be low.

A lot depends on the solution architecture, but discussing the technology stack during the first few meetings helps both Liferay and the prospect to set the expectations right. Liferay is agnostic to many technologies and also provides freedom to choose backend and frontend technology. 

### Current System

In line with the technology stack, the set of questions can be around how seamlessly Liferay could integrate to existing systems. It is important then to learn what the existing technologies that need to be integrated with are, and for the prospect to know how Liferay can fit in.

### Sizing

Last but not least is sizing, whether it is SaaS, PaaS, or on-premise, sizing the implementation correctly is very important at the early stages of the opportunity because sizing helps to inform the overall cost and even though it may not be possible to learn everything this early on, it is required at the beginning to progress with the opportunity.

Great, that’s the end of this module - next, learn how to demonstrate the experience for users who’ve not logged on to Liferay.
