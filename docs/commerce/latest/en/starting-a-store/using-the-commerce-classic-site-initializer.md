# Using the Commerce Classic Site Initializer

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q4+/GA129+`
{bdg-link-primary}`[Beta Feature](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags#beta-feature-flags)`

A Site Initializer bundles together pages, content, and configurations to help you jump-start a new site with much of the site already built. You can reuse them across multiple Liferay instances to replicate the essential components of your sites quickly. The new Commerce Classic site initializer comes with the following pages out-of-the-box:

* [Catalog](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/catalog.md)
* [Product Details](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/product-details.md)
* [Checkout](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/checkout.md)
* [Compare](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/compare.md)
* [Pending Orders](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/pending-orders.md)
* [Placed Orders](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/placed-orders.md)
* [Search](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/search.md)
* Returns 
* [Account Management](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/account-management.md)
* [Lists (for wishlists)](../creating-store-content/commerce-storefront-pages/lists.md)

!!! note
    You can edit the look and feel, layout, and contents of each of these pages to adapt them to your requirements.
