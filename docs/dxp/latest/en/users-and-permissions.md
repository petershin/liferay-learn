# Users and Permissions

Liferay comes with a comprehensive framework to manage user access and roles within Liferay. To support complex organizational needs, there are several entities within the framework that you can use.

* [Users](./users-and-permissions/users.md) - Every person who accesses a Liferay site is considered a user.
* [User Groups](./users-and-permissions/user-groups.md) - A user group is a list of users created for a specific purpose. User groups can be created across the hierarchical boundaries of organizations.
* [Accounts](./users-and-permissions/accounts.md) - Accounts provide administrators with a way to organize and manage users for various commerce or business needs.
* [Organizations](./users-and-permissions/organizations.md) - Organizations enable distributed user and site management that reflects real world organizational hierarchies. Organizations can nest to an unlimited number of hierarchical levels.
* [Roles and Permissions](./users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions.md) - Roles join users with permissions. To get things done in Liferay, users must have the proper permissions.
