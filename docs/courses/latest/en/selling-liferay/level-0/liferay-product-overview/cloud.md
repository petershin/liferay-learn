# Cloud

Liferay DXP can be deployed in 3 different ways: SaaS, PaaS, and Self-Hosted.

The Liferay SaaS offering empowers customers to focus on business processes and time-to-value while providing powerful customization capabilities. With Liferay PaaS, customers can directly manage their solution life cycle with built-in CI/CD, automated backups, monitoring, and alerts. Liferay Self-Hosted users have the flexibity to deploy into their chosen cloud-provider, with the understanding of the additional responsibilities that places on them.

## Three Different Deployments

* **Liferay SaaS:** Liferay DXP fully managed by Liferay, with weekly updates, testing, and Application Uptime SLA.
* **Liferay PaaS:** Infrastructure managed by Liferay, Liferay DXP Managed by customer, and Infrastructure Uptime SLA.
* **Liferay Self-Hosted:** When Liferay’s SaaS and PaaS are not an option, customers can deploy DXP in public and private cloud, or on-premise as required.
