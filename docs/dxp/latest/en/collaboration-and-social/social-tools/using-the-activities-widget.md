Each item listed in the widget contains a link to the user and the asset (for example, a *Message Boards* post, or a wiki page). Clicking on the user redirects to the person's profile.

Clicking on the link redirects to the site page where the asset is located.

Lastly, click *RSS* to subscribe to the user activities.
