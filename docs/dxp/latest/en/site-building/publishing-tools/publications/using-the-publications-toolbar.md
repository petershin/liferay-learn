# Using the Publications Toolbar

The Publications Toolbar provides essential information for Publications users, including the name of the current publication or *Production* if working in the production environment.

The toolbar appears at the top of the screen after [enabling Publications](./enabling-publications.md), where you can navigate between publications, access production, create new publications, and review changes made in the current publication.

## Displaying Warnings

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q4+`

!!! important
    Currently, this feature is behind a release feature flag (LPD-20556). Read [Release Feature Flags](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#release-feature-flags) for more information.

When working with [web content articles](../../../content-authoring-and-management/web-content/web-content-articles.md), the Publications Toolbar displays warnings to manage updates and prevent conflicts.

<!-- TODO: Currently, it's just working with WC articles, but the team will probably expand this functionality to other components. When it does, this part needs to be rewritten to reflect the new components. Eric -->

Warnings appear next to the toolbar in the following scenarios:

**Concurrent Edits**: When a user edits an article in one publication and another user simultaneously edits the same article in a different publication, the timeline icon appears yellow, indicating a potential conflict.

**Production Modifications**: If a user in a publication edits an article that was modified and published in production, the timeline icon appears red, indicating a production conflict.

![The toolbar displays warnings if another user is editing the article in another publication or if it has been modified in production.](./using-the-publications-toolbar/images/02.png)

## Using the Publication Timeline

To view a list of modifications made to entities, click the *Publication Timeline* (![Publication Timeline icon](../../../images/icon-time.png)) icon (1).

!!! note
    The publicationâ€™s timeline displays all pertinent web content articles, including those stored in folders.

With the appropriate permissions, access the *Actions* menu (![Actions menu](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) for a specific modification. The available actions include Edit the Article in Another Publication, Review Changes, Move Changes, or Discard Changes (2).

!!! important
    For articles modified in publications, only users with `Edit` permissions can access the "Edit in Publication", "Discard Change", "Move Change", and "View Change" options. Users with `View` permissions can only access the "View Change" option. Users without any permissions can't access any of those actions.

    For articles modified in production, only the "View Change" option is available.

When several modifications exist, click *View More* (3) at the bottom of the publication's timeline to open the View Entity Modification History page, where you can view all modifications, and access the options to Discard Changes, Edit in Publication, Move Changes, or Review Changes.

View on Production is only available for pages that already exist in production.

A *Viewing Production* indicator appears in the toolbar. To return to the publication, open the toolbar and select *Work on [Publication's name]*.
