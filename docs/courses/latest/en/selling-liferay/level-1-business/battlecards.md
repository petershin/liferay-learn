## Background

This module explains how to learn about Liferay’s competitors by using the competitor Battlecards.

The level 0 session on [Competitive Landscape and Liferay Positioning](../level-0/competitive-landscape-and-liferay-positioning.md) discussed Liferay positioning and the Competitive Landscape - looking at four categories of vendor that Liferay typically competes with and how to position for each of those.

This module introduces the Competitive Battlecards that have been produced for the main vendors in each of those categories, covering how they are built and maintained, along with where to find them and how they are structured.

The actual content of this module are the Battlecards themselves. In order to learn more about the competitors please download them and study them.

Further to that, anyone with additional information about a competitor can play a part and contribute that information to enhance the Battlecards further. Please provide feedback if there is critical information missing.

## Introduction to the Competitor Battlecards

Liferay’s Sales Enablement team uses a leading third party intelligence tool called Kompyte to scrape information of chosen competitors into one central location. This helps to create and update Battlecards with basic data relatively quickly and from public and generally reliable sources.

Additionally, feedback and information about competitors gathered internally and from partners is incorporated into the Battlecards.

The most critical source of these updates comes from sales people because of meetings with buyers, seeing competitors in opportunities, hearing feedback from colleagues, champions and the broader network.

Being vocal and providing that feedback internally or for partners through the CAMs is highly encouraged. This applies both when winning a deal over a competitor, and when losing to a competitor. In both circumstances most likely there was something in particular that either helped to win over a competitor, or that caused the deal to be lost.

New Battlecards are created throughout the year, with existing Battlecards updated on a Quarterly basis. The quarterly update information is located at the top of the Battlecard, and highlights anything new that the competitor has released or announced that may impact your conversations. 

## Competition grouped by Category

![Liferay's competitors fit into four categories: DXPs, Enterprise Suites, Composable Point Solutions, Low-Code Application Platforms](./battlecards/images/01.png)

The graphic above shows the major vendors that Liferay competes against. Note that not all are pure plays, some suite vendors pushed into the Low-Code market in the last few years, and some DXP vendors added composability with Headless APIs.

Liferay is uniquely positioned in the middle of all these categories. First, Liferay is a complete, integrated Digital Experience Platform. Liferay also has Low-Code capabilities, provides a market leading composable Content Management System (CMS), and can be easily integrated with suite vendors. 

This gives Liferay's Partners and Customers the flexibility to use Liferay as the foundation of their digital experience transformatiomn in a way that is fully integrated with their enterprise architecture, and of course can be deployed as SaaS, PaaS, or Self-Hosted.
