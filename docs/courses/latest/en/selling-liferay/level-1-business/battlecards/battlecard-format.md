# Competitive Intelligence: Battlecard Format

**At a Glance**

* All Battlecards follow the same structure
* Sections are sourced by scraped data and manually collected information 
* Each Battlecard provides a direct link to the vendor or alliance website

## Battlecard Format

Each Battlecard has three sections:

* Company snapshot
* Selling against
* Dynamic content

To make this section more meaningful the Optimizely battlecard is used as an example.

### Company Snapshot

The Company Snapshot section provides information on the company and its product offerings to provide a summary of the company and what they sell.

Each battlecard includes:

* Company overview
* Competitive products and solutuions
* Quarterly updates
* Mergers and acquisitions

In some cases, as with Optimizely, additional information relevant to the company or product is also included.

This section is compiled from scraped and manually added information.

### Selling Against

The Selling Against section provides information geared toward helping understand the way the competitor attempts to position their product and what their strengths and weaknesses are.

Generally the following information is included:

* Competitor’s Strengths and Weaknesses
* Why Liferay Wins or Loses
* Liferay Win Stories

The information in this section is manually sourced from Liferay’s Product Marketing team, industry analysts, and user reviews as well as feedback from the field where it is available.

### Dynamic Content

The Dynamic Content section contains a snapshot of the most recent updates and communication including:

* Press releases
* News
* Product ratings
* Company ratings
* Social media posts

Information in this section is sourced from data scraped from Social Media platforms, event pages, the competitor’s website, and so on.

Next: The final module in this learning path covers [Liferay’s Contracts](../liferay-contracts.md).
