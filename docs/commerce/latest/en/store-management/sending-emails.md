# Sending Emails

You can configure Liferay to send email notifications for different events that happen in your store. For example, you may want to send updates to the order manager or another person of interest with details of the order. This can include the order ID, shipping and billing addresses, the payment method used, and more. To do this, you must create a notification template that determines the email's contents and event trigger.

!!! note
    To use notifications in Commerce, you must first configure Liferay's mail settings. See [Configuring Mail](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/installation-and-upgrades/setting-up-liferay/configuring-mail) for more information.

There are two ways to set up these notifications.

* Creating a notification template to be executed as an Object Action (preferred)
* Creating a notification template at the channel level

## Notification Templates (Object Action)

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Templates*.

1. Click *Add* (![Add](../images/icon-add.png)) to create a notification template. See [Notification Template](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/process-automation/notifications/creating-notification-templates) for more information on configuring a template.

After creating a notification template, you must assign it as an object action on the Commerce Order object. See [Defining Object Actions](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/liferay-development/objects/creating-and-managing-objects/actions/defining-object-actions) for more information.

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q3+/Portal 7.4 GA125+` A new notification template called Commerce Order Notification is available out-of-the-box. It is an object action on the Commerce Order object that sends an email to the order creator when the order status changes to *Pending*. It is currently behind a [release feature flag](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags#release-feature-flags) (LPD-24498).

### Notification Queue

Liferay provides a notification queue for reviewing email notifications triggered by an Object action. You can verify the status of notifications and resend them if needed. See [Notification Queue](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/process-automation/notifications/using-the-notification-queue) for more information.

## Notification Templates (Channel)

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Commerce* &rarr; *Channels*.

1. Select the appropriate channel and go to *Notification Templates*.

1. Click *Add* (![Add](../images/icon-add.png)) to create a notification template. 

These notifications are configured per [channel](./channels.md). When designing an email template, you can enter text directly or use variables to include data from the triggering event dynamically. See [Using Notification Templates](./sending-emails/using-notification-templates.md) and [Notification Template Variables Reference Guide](./sending-emails/notification-template-variables-reference-guide.md) for more information.

There's also a Notification Queue tab under a channel that displays all the email notifications. Each email notification entry shows its sender, recipients, event type, status, and priority. By default, Liferay checks the notification queue every 15 minutes for unsent notifications. See [Configuring the Commerce Notification Queue](./sending-emails/configuring-the-commerce-notification-queue.md) to learn how to configure this behavior.
