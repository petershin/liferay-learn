# Level 1 for Business Sales Roles

Welcome to the Level 1 Selling Liferay learning path for Business Sales roles! Level 1 expands on the [Level 0](./level-0.md) foundation to show Liferay sellers how to succeed in the process, all the way from generating prospects to closing deals and working with Liferay’s contracts.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this course you’ll have learned

* How to create a healthy pipeline of Liferay opportunities
* How to effectively have a sales conversation with prospective customers, inspire them to share needs, and be able to prove value
* How to showcase the possibilities Liferay offers and ROI to drive an opportunity from qualification to close

## Roles

This learning path is for all business sales roles including, but not limited to

* Account Executives (AEs)
* Business Development Representatives (BDRs)
* Sales Development Representatives (SDRs)
* Channel Account Managers (CAMs)

It's also useful for other roles in the sales process such as Sales Engineers (SEs) but is not mandatory for them.
