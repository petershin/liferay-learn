# Cart

You can use the Cart page to manage the contents of your cart. There are three associated widgets: _Cart_, _Cart Summary_, _Mini Cart_.

**Cart** displays the contents of the cart. The widget contains the _Update_ button to change the quantity and _Delete_ button to remove items from the cart.

**Cart Summary** displays the cart's subtotal, any applicable taxes, the total amount, and the _Checkout_ button.

**Mini Cart** displays the cartâ€™s contents and an _Edit Cart_ button that links to the Commerce _Cart_ widget.
