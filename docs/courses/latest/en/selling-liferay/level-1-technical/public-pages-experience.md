# Pre-Login Experience

**At a Glance**

* First impressions count in demos
* Start with public pages when prospects have not seen Liferay before
* Have a clear understanding of the time available
* If the use-case is known, use a demo aligned to that use case
* Always use a demo with engaging look and feel, even if the use case is not known

## Background

When presenting to a room full of decision makers, like CEOs, CTOs, CMOs, Enterprise Architects and so on, the goal is to create a lasting impact.

The purpose of this module is to provide the guidance needed to ensure that the first pages that your prospects see give this lasting impact.

It is likely that the demo is the first time that the prospective customer has seen Liferay. While it might be tempting to immediately login, the starting point for any Liferay demo should be an engaging, content-rich home or landing page, before logging in. 

Be patient, there is time to get to showing a particular use-case, which will usually be post login, but it is a mistake to breeze past the login stage because the home page provides an excellent opportunity to showcase a lot of Liferay’s out-of-the-box capabilities and help the prospect to become excited about what they’ve seen and the potential that Liferay provides.

This first impression is always remembered, and while it may not be the make-or-break step in an opportunity, since prospects _remember_ these first pages, do not miss the chance to make them count.

To make it easier to follow the different aspects of these public pages, or pre-login experience the topics to cover during the demo are grouped into the following sections: 

* Home or Landing page
* Other public pages 
* Navigation and Search
* Themes and Styles
* Scalability

## Introducing the demo

Remember that this is probably the first time that the prospect is seeing the actual Liferay product, so the first few screens shown and first few things mentioned have a lasting impact.

It is important to set the expectations, via an agenda, or what is to be covered in the demo. Without this, what often happens is that the prospect asks questions about topics that are to be covered later.

A really important thing to know before beginning the demo is how much time is available. Ideally, and in most cases, this is known before the session, but if it isn’t clear it is never wrong to ask. The worst case scenario is if the most valuable part of the demo is only reached after most of the audience has left the meeting!

Before showing the first screen use the first minute or two to talk about the demo that is going to be presented. If it is something specific that the prospect has asked to see, make sure that this is reconfirmed to be certain that the time is being used effectively.

Alternatively, it might be that this is an introductory demo, using one of Liferay’s out-of-the-box templates. For this module the Masterclass template is being used, so this can be introduced by saying something like:

“Today we’re going to use one of the pre-built Liferay templates called Masterclass. Masterclass is a learning management solution built using Liferay’s out-of-the-box features.”

It is always much better to use a demo which is aligned with the prospect’s requirements, so this is a fall-back position if there hasn’t been an opportunity to discover the problem the customer is trying to solve. If using a non-aligned demo, always explain why, if it’s because the use case hasn’t been shared, say so. If it’s an outbound-generated opportunity and the prospect is interested, but doesn’t yet know if they have a problem to solve, say so.
