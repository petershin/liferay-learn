# Manage and Optimize

Liferay Cloud offers numerous tools to help you efficiently manage your project. Invite members to your team and grant them different permissions with [roles](./manage-and-optimize/environment-teams-and-roles.md).

Liferay Cloud also offers tools to track and monitor your project's resource usage. You can [view real-time data on each service's performance](./manage-and-optimize/application-metrics.md), [receive alerts on unexpected behaviors](./manage-and-optimize/real-time-alerts.md), and [keep track of what your team members are doing](./manage-and-optimize/team-activities.md).

To optimize the Liferay service's performance, Liferay Cloud can [scale automatically](./manage-and-optimize/auto-scaling.md) to meet traffic demands while conserving resources.

These tools help ensure your project runs efficiently within the [quotas](./manage-and-optimize/quotas-and-resource-usage.md) set by your subscription.
