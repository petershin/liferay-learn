# Manage and Optimize

Liferay Cloud offers numerous tools to help you efficiently manage your projects.

## Resource Management

The Liferay Cloud dashboard has built-in tools to help you track and monitor your project's resource usage. You can [view real-time data on each service's performance](./manage-and-optimize/application-metrics.md) and [receive alerts on unexpected behaviors](./manage-and-optimize/real-time-alerts.md).

To optimize the Liferay service's performance, Liferay Cloud can [scale automatically](./manage-and-optimize/scaling-the-liferay-service.md) to meet traffic demands while conserving resources.

These tools help ensure your project runs efficiently within the [quotas](./manage-and-optimize/quotas-and-resource-usage.md) set by your subscription.

## Team Management

With Liferay Cloud, you can collaborate in projects with your team to distribute the work as necessary. Invite members to your team and grant them different permissions with [roles](./manage-and-optimize/environment-teams-and-roles.md).

Liferay Cloud keeps track of everything collaborators do and displays a [history of activities](./manage-and-optimize/team-activities.md) in the Activities tab.

Here, you can find a list of all kinds of events in a given environment, including

- **Backup Activities**: examples include when automated or manual backups start, and whether they succeed.
- **Scaling Activities**: examples include when auto-scaling is enabled or disabled, and when the Liferay service is scaled up or down.
- **Secret Activities**: examples include when a secret variable is added, edited, viewed, or removed.
- **Team Activities**: examples include when environment invitations are sent, and when new members join the environment.
