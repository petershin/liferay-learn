# Using a Theme CSS Client Extension

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4+`

With a theme CSS client extension, you can override the current theme's CSS files (`main.css` and `clay.css`) to change the look and feel of a page. Start with a client extension from the [sample workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace).

Beginning with Liferay DXP 7.4 Q2/Portal 7.4 GA120, you can provide a [frontend token definition](../../site-building/site-appearance/style-books/developer-guide/frontend-token-definitions.md) in a theme CSS client extension. Earlier releases required a theme module. You must use at least version `10.1.1` of the workspace plugin, `com.liferay.gradle.plugins.workspace`. Set this in the `settings.gradle` file at the root of the [workspace](../tooling/liferay-workspace.md):

```groovy
classpath group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.gradle.plugins.workspace", version: "10.1.1"
```

## Prerequisites

1. Install a [supported version of Java](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-Quarterly-Releases-Compatibility-Matrix).

    ```{note}
    Check the [compatibility matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-7-4-Compatibility-Matrix) for supported JDKs, databases, and environments. See [JVM Configuration](../../installation-and-upgrades/reference/jvm-configuration.md) for recommended JVM settings.
    ```

1. Download and unzip the sample workspace:

   ```bash
   curl -o com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/content\?r\=liferay-public-releases\&g\=com.liferay.workspace\&a\=com.liferay.sample.workspace\&\v\=LATEST\&p\=zip
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip
   ```

Now you have the tools to deploy your first theme CSS client extension.

## Examine How the Theme's Styles are Overridden

The theme CSS client extension is in the sample workspace's `client-extensions/liferay-sample-theme-css-1/` folder. It is defined in the `client-extension.yaml` file:

```yaml
liferay-sample-theme-css-1:
    clayURL: css/clay.css
    mainURL: css/main.css
    name: Liferay Sample Theme CSS 1
    type: themeCSS
```

The client extension has the ID `liferay-sample-theme-css-1` and contains the key configurations for a theme CSS client extension, including the type and path to the two CSS resource files. See the [Theme CSS YAML Configuration Reference](./using-a-theme-css-client-extension/theme-css-yaml-configuration-reference.md) for more information on the available properties.

It also contains the `assemble` YAML block:

```yaml
assemble:
    - from: build/buildTheme/img
      into: static/img
```

This specifies that after building the theme, everything in the `build/buildTheme/img/` folder should be included as a static resource in the built client extension `.zip` file. The image file included in the theme CSS client extension is used as a static resource in Liferay.

The `package.json` file contains the following code:

```json
{
   "dependencies": {
      "sassy-inputs": "1.0.6"
   },
   "liferayDesignPack": {
      "baseTheme": "styled"
   },
   "main": "package.json",
   "name": "@liferay/liferay-sample-theme-css-1",
   "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

The `dependencies` section includes the `sassy-inputs` library. This is not used in the example, but shows how to import and use an npm module in your theme CSS client extension. The `liferayDesignPack` section declares the base theme used for the styles. Using the `styled` theme ensures that the existing styles specified on pages, fragments and widgets are not impacted. The other fields `main`, `name` and `version` provide required metadata.

```{note}
You can set the base theme to `styled` or `unstyled`. The unstyled theme contains a set of basic styles and the `styled` theme contains all styles from the `unstyled` theme along with additional styling. All themes in Liferay use the `unstyled` or `styled` theme as the base. 

If you apply the theme CSS client extension to a page that uses a different theme, the client extension's styling **replaces** the styling from the theme. If you have custom styles in your original theme, make sure you add those to the `_custom.scss` file so that those elements are not affected when you apply the client extension. 

If you change the theme of a page that already uses a theme CSS client extension, the client extension is removed. 
```

The `src/css/_custom.scss` file contains this SCSS:

```css
@import 'sassy-inputs/sass/main';

header {
   background-image: url(../img/header_bg.jpg); 
}
```

The first line imports the npm module added in `package.json`. The CSS modifies the header to use an image as its background.

```{note}
Your code is present inside `_custom.scss` while the `client-extension.yaml` file points to `clay.css` and `main.css`. This is because the theme CSS client extension runs the full Clay CSS build process resulting in a compiled `clay.css` and `main.css` file that also contains the compiled CSS code from `_custom.scss`.
```

## Modify the Theme CSS

Add CSS to create a hover effect for all images. Open the `_custom.scss` file and add a declaration for `img:hover`:

```css
img:hover{
   border: 2px solid red;
   border-radius: 10%;
}
```

This defines images as having a `2px` red border and rounded edges on hover.

Now deploy the client extension.

## Deploy Your Theme CSS Client Extension

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Once Liferay starts, run this command from the client extension's folder in the sample workspace:

```bash
../../gradlew clean deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
```

This builds your client extension and deploys the zip to Liferay's `deploy/` folder.

```{note}
To deploy your client extension to Liferay SaaS, use the Liferay Cloud [Command-Line Tool](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool) to run [`lcp deploy`](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool#deploying-to-your-liferay-cloud-environment).
```

```{tip}
To deploy all client extensions in the workspace simultaneously, run the command from the `client-extensions/` folder.
```

Confirm the deployment in your Liferay instance's console:

```bash
STARTED liferay-sample-theme-css-1_1.0.0
```

## Apply the Theme CSS Client Extension to a Page

You can apply the theme CSS client extension to all pages at once. In fact, to provide a frontend token definition using a theme CSS client extension, you must apply the client extension this way:

1. Open *Site Menu* ([Site Menu](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)), expand *Site Builder*, and click _Pages_.

1. Click *Options* ([Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) &rarr; *Configuration*.

1. Scroll down to *Theme CSS Client Extension* and apply it to all pages.

   ![Apply the Theme CSS client extension to all pages at once.](./using-a-theme-css-client-extension/images/03.png)

To configure a single page to use your theme CSS: 

1. On a page, click _Edit_ (![Edit icon](../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) at the top.

1. In the sidebar, navigate to the _Page Design Options_ menu (![Page Design Options icon](../../images/icon-format.png)) and click _Configuration_ (![Configuration icon](../../images/icon-cog3.png)) at the top of the menu.

1. In the Theme CSS Client Extension section under the Look and Feel tab, click _Add_ (![Add](../../images/icon-duplicate.png)).

1. Select the newly deployed client extension, _Liferay Sample Theme CSS 1_.

   ![Select the Sample Theme CSS client extension and click Save.](./using-a-theme-css-client-extension/images/01.png)

1. Scroll down and click _Save_.

In the page editor, the background on the header is an image, and every link that you hover over has changed background and text color. To see your changes applied on the page outside Edit mode, you must publish the page.
