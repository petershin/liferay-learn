# Configuring Shipping Methods

Liferay supports two shipping methods out-of-the-box, [Flat Rate](./configuring-shipping-methods/using-the-flat-rate-shipping-method.md) and [Variable Rate](./configuring-shipping-methods/using-the-variable-rate-shipping-method.md). Before choosing any shipping method, verify the [Measurement Units](./configuring-shipping-methods/measurement-units.md) that the store uses. Shipping methods may be restricted by country or region. To learn more, see [Applying Shipping Method Restrictions](./configuring-shipping-methods/applying-shipping-method-restrictions.md). 

For users interested in adding other shipping methods or carriers, see [Using the Shipping Engine Client Extension](../developer-guide/using-client-extensions/using-the-shipping-engine-client-extension.md).
