In the previous module, you learned about some of the tools, techniques, and best practices for building sites with Liferay. Now that Clarity has an enterprise marketing website structured and styled, they need content to populate it. Fortunately, Liferay offers a suite of features for authoring and managing content that you can leverage to bring the site to life. 

By the end of this module, you'll know how to:

* Create, store, and leverage digital assets across your Liferay instance
* Build content structures and templates to enforce consistent standards
* Organize your content using tags, categories, and collections
* Leverage commerce features to create product-related content
* Track, review, and collaborate on changes before they go to production
* Implement approval processes to improve visibility and efficiency in the content creation cycle
* Build business forms to collect user data and drive engagement

<!--TASK: Consider adding AI features here as well.-->

Throughout this module, you'll learn best practices for creating and managing content for enterprise websites. First, let's take a closer look at Clarity's content requirements.
