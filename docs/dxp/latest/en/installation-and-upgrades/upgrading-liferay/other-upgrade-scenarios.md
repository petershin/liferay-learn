# Other Upgrade Scenarios

If you're upgrading a clustered installation, you must follow an upgrade approach that fits your cluster requirements. See [Maintaining Clustered Installations](../maintaining-a-liferay-installation/maintaining-clustered-installations.md) to learn the different ways to upgrade a clustered installation.

If your current installation is physically partitioned (sharded), you must migrate each partition to its own DXP/Portal installation. Learn more at [Upgrading a Sharded Environment](./other-upgrade-scenarios/upgrading-a-sharded-environment.md).
