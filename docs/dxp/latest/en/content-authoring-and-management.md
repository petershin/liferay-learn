# Content Authoring and Management

Liferay provides applications you can use to create and manage your content. These applications include [Web Content](./content-authoring-and-management/web-content/web-content-articles/adding-a-basic-web-content-article.md), [Documents and Media](./content-authoring-and-management/documents-and-media.md), [Collections](site-building/displaying-content/collections-and-collection-pages/about-collections-and-collection-pages.md), and more. You can use these applications directly in each of your Sites, or create [Asset Libraries](./content-authoring-and-management/asset-libraries.md) to create instance-scoped assets and Collections that can be shared across Sites. [Tags and Categories](./content-authoring-and-management/tags-and-categories.md) make it easier to organize, find, and display your content.
