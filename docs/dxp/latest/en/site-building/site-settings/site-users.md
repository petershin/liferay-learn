# Site Users

Managing site users in Liferay involves configuring how users join your site and assigning them appropriate roles and teams by default. These settings help streamline user management and ensure that members have the right permissions and access levels from the start.

Using site membership types, you can determine how users can join your site. See [Changing Site Membership Type](./site-users/changing-site-membership-type.md) to learn more about the membership types.

You can also set default roles and teams for new site members to ensure they have the necessary permissions and access as soon as they join the site. See [Configuring Role and Team Defaults for Site Members](./site-users/configuring-role-and-team-defaults-for-site-members.md) to learn more.
