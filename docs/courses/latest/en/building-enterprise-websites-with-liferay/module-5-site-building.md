In the previous modules, we've seen how Clarity can leverage Liferay's user management features to import users and establish role-based access control. Now, it’s time to start contributing to Clarity’s public enterprise website! Liferay provides out-of-the-box tools for designing personalized website experiences across multiple channels and devices with ease. With a drag-and-drop visual page editor, Liferay's site building tools empower non-technical users to create and preview web pages without needing to write code. This allows for greater agility and content ownership. Liferay also provides more technical users with advanced features for extending a site's style and creating page elements with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Throughout this module, you'll take on different Clarity personas and experience how Liferay's intuitive interface empowers them to implement site architecture, styling, and page design with speed and ease.
