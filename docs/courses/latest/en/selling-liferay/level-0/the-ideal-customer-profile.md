## Selling vs. Walking Away

It is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses that your organization has and that the product you are selling has. 

It is not possible to win every opportunity unless there are unlimited resources available---and as such we must prioritize opportunities and prospects:

* Sometimes solving the customer’s requirements requires using Liferay with another technology or working with another partner because we would not be able to win alone.
* Sometimes we must walk away from an opportunity if we’re not in a position to win it.
* Sales strategies that aren’t based on reality have a low chance of succeeding. Realism and optimism are not opposites.

“Bad news early is good news.” Confronting reality during the various stages of a sale helps in adjusting the strategy to ensure the win or alternatively to re-allocate the time and money to an opportunity that can be won.

To meet clients’ buying criteria or to effectively change them, we must understand their needs well. And we must understand how well our offering can meet those needs:

* It is unlikely that one vendor meets every requirement of every buyer. 
* What matters is meeting the needs well enough and better than the competitors.
* Pursuing major contracts is very expensive. 
* Finishing second costs as much as winning the contract, but there’s no reward at the end. 

Start by learning about where Liferay shines.
