# Asset Framework

The asset framework is behind many of Liferay's most powerful features. It provides tools for displaying and interacting with any type of content and data. For example, if you build an event management application that displays a list of upcoming events, you can use the asset framework to let users add tags, categories, or comments to make entries more descriptive. Using the asset framework is also the first step for integrating other important frameworks such as segmentation or workflow.

The term *asset* refers to any type of content: text, a file, a URL, an image, a document, a blog entry, a bookmark, a wiki page, or anything you create in your application.

The asset framework tutorials assume that you are already familiar with using Liferay's [Service Builder](./service-builder.md). Follow the links below to learn how to enable assets and to enhance the implementation of assets.
