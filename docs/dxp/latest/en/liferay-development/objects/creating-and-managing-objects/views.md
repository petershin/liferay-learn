# Views

Views define how entries appear in an object's application page. All published objects include an autogenerated table that displays all field columns alphabetically. However, you can [design custom views](./views/designing-object-views.md) to determine which fields to include, how columns are ordered, and available [filters](./views/adding-filters-to-views.md).

```{note}
Custom views can only be added to custom objects. They cannot be added to system objects.
```
