# Using a Frontend Data Set Filter Client Extension

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q2+/Portal 7.4 GA120+`

Frontend data set filter client extensions define JavaScript functions for creating customizable filter interfaces. Add these extensions to [data set views](../data-sets/data-set-views/data-set-view-filters.md) to enhance the user experience by providing tailored filtering capabilities.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Java (JDK 8 or JDK 11).

   !!! note
       Check the [compatibility matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-7-4-Compatibility-Matrix) for supported JDKs, databases, and environments. See [JVM Configuration](../../installation-and-upgrades/reference/jvm-configuration.md) for recommended JVM settings.

1. Download and unzip the sample workspace:

   ```bash
   curl -o com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/content\?r\=liferay-public-releases\&g\=com.liferay.workspace\&a\=com.liferay.sample.workspace\&\v\=LATEST\&p\=zip
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip
   ```

Now you have the tools to deploy your first custom filter via a client extension.

## Examine and Modify the Custom Filter

The frontend data set filter client extension is in the sample workspace's `client-extensions/liferay-sample-fds-filter/` folder. It's defined in the `client-extension.yaml` file:

```yaml
liferay-sample-fds-filter:
    name: Liferay Sample FDS Filter
    type: fdsFilter
    url: index.*.js
```

The client extension has the ID `liferay-sample-fds-filter` and contains the key configurations for a Custom Element client extension, including the `type` and the `url` properties that define the JavaScript resource file's location.

It also contains the `assemble` block:

```yaml
assemble:
    - from: build/static
      into: static
```

This specifies that everything in the `build/static` folder should be included as a static resource in the built client extension `.zip` file. The JavaScript files in a client extension are used as static resources in Liferay.

### Understand the Code

The `src/index.ts` file defines three main JavaScript functions that provide a customizable filter interface: `descriptionBuilder`, `htmlElementBuilder`, and `oDataQueryBuilder`, which are responsible for describing the filter's state, rendering the filter's UI, and building the OData query respectively.

The `descriptionBuilder()` function takes the filter's internal state (`selectedData`) and returns it as a human-readable string. Here, it returns the OData query string entered by the user.

```javascript
function descriptionBuilder(selectedData: FilterData): string {
	return selectedData;
}
```

The `htmlElementBuilder()` function renders the UI shown to the user when configuring the filter. It creates an input field for the OData query string, a submit button, and attaches an event handler to the button to update the filter's state using the `setFilter` callback.

It creates a `div` element, assigns it the class name `dropdown-item`, appends the input field and button to this div, and then returns the div.

```javascript
	const div = document.createElement('div');
	div.className = 'dropdown-item';

	div.appendChild(input);
	div.appendChild(button);

	return div;
```

The `oDataQueryBuilder()` function takes the filter's internal state (`selectedData`) and returns it as the OData query string for filtering the data set.

```javascript
function oDataQueryBuilder(selectedData: FilterData): string {
	return selectedData;
}
```

Then, an object `fdsFilter` is created that implements the `FDSFilter` interface, incorporating the three main functions defined above. And this object is exported as the default export of the module.
```javascript
const fdsFilter: FDSFilter<FilterData> = {
	descriptionBuilder,
	htmlElementBuilder,
	oDataQueryBuilder,
};

export default fdsFilter;
```

Now, deploy the client extension.

## Deploy the Custom Element Client Extension to Liferay

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Once Liferay starts, run this command from the client extension's folder in the sample workspace:

```bash
../../gradlew clean deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
```

This builds your client extension and deploys the zip to Liferay's `deploy/` folder.

!!! note
    To deploy your client extension to Liferay SaaS, use the Liferay Cloud [Command-Line Tool](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool) to run [`lcp deploy`](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool#deploying-to-your-liferay-cloud-environment).

!!! tip
    To deploy all client extensions in the workspace simultaneously, run the command from the `client-extensions/` folder.

Confirm the deployment in your Liferay instance's console:

```
STARTED liferaysamplecustomelement1_7.4.13
```

Now that your client extension is deployed, check if the filter is working properly.

## Add the Custom Filter to a Data Set View

{bdg-link-primary}`[Beta Feature](../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#beta-feature-flags)`

!!! important
    Currently, this feature is behind a [beta feature flag](../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#beta-feature-flags) (LPS-164563).

Start by setting up the environment:

1. Enable the `LPS-164563` [beta feature flag](../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/feature-flags.md#beta-feature-flags).

1. [Create a site](../../getting-started/creating-your-first-site.md) using the `Minium` template.

   This populates the database with products to be displayed in the data set view.

   ![Create a site based on the Minium template.](./using-a-frontend-data-set-filter-client-extension/images/01.png)

Create the data set and the data set view:

1. [Create a Data Set](../data-sets/creating-data-sets.md) using these settings:

   | Field            | Content                                 |
   | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
   | Name             | `Products`                              |
   | REST Application | `/headless-commerce-admin-catalog/v1.0` |
   | REST Schema      | `Product`                               |
   | REST Endpoint    | `/v1.0/products`                        |

   ![Create a data set to display products.](./using-a-frontend-data-set-filter-client-extension/images/02.png)

1. [Create a Data Set View](../data-sets/data-set-views.md#creating-data-set-views), name it `Products Data Set View`, and click *Save*.

1. Click on the *Products Data Set View* to start editing it.

   Alternatively, click *Actions* (![Actions menu](../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the view and select *Edit* (![Edit](../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)).

1. Select the *Visualization Modes* tab.

1. Click *Add* (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) and select the `catalogId`, `id`, and `name` fields.

   This adds the three fields to the table visualization mode displayed in the data set view.

   ![Add the `catalogId`, `id`, and `name` fields to the table visualization mode.](./using-a-frontend-data-set-filter-client-extension/images/03.png)

1. Select the *Filters* tab.

1. Click *Add* (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) and select *Client Extension*. Fill in the information using these settings:

   | Field            | Content                     |
   | :--------------- | :-------------------------- |
   | Name             | `Filter by Name`            |
   | Filter By        | `name`                      |
   | Client Extension | `Liferay Sample FDS Filter` |

   ![Add the Liferay Sample FDS Filter client extension to the data set view.](./using-a-frontend-data-set-filter-client-extension/images/04.png)

   !!! tip
       To ensure the filter works across different "Filter By" fields, the frontend data set filter client extension should be coded to handle various field names dynamically. Since the selected field in "Filter By" is accessible from the code, the filter can be applied generically, eliminating the need to create separate client extensions for each field.

Add the data set view to a content page:

1. [Create a new page](../../site-building/creating-pages/adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md) or [Start editing](../../site-building/creating-pages/using-content-pages/adding-elements-to-content-pages.md) one.

1. In the Fragments and Widgets menu on the left, search for Data Set under fragments. Drag and drop the fragment in your editing area.

1. Click on your fragment. In the General tab on your right, there is a field where you can select a Data Set View. Click *Add* (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add-app.png)) and select the *Products Data Set View*.

   ![Select the Products Data Set View and display it using the Data Set fragment.](./using-a-frontend-data-set-filter-client-extension/images/05.png)

1. Publish the page.

Navigate to the page to test the filter:

1. Next to the page's name, click *Actions* (![Actions menu](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *View* (![View icon](../../images/icon-view.png)).

1. Click *Filter* and select the *Filter by Name* option under the search bar.

1. Select the search field, type in `name eq 'Piston'`, and click *Submit*.

   The table displays only the products named *Piston*.

   ![Use OData queries to filter products by name.](./using-a-frontend-data-set-filter-client-extension/images/06.png)

You have successfully deployed and used a frontend data set filter client extension in Liferay. Next, try [using data set view actions](../data-sets/data-set-views/using-data-set-view-actions.md) and customize your data set even further.
