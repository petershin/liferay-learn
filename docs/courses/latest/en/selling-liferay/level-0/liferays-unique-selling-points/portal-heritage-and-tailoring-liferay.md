# Portal Heritage and Tailoring Liferay

**At a Glance**

* Liferay is easy to tailor and customize
* Liferay excels at delivering experiences for many audiences and use cases

The DXP landscape consists of a majority of vendors who started out as content management systems providers and others who came from a CRM or ERP background. Liferay differs by having a strong horizontal portal heritage.

Liferay’s portal heritage gives us a unique perspective:

* Strong Integration
* Personalization & Authentication
* Secure data handling
* Digital agility

## Integration Capabilities

Digital experience platforms empower companies to embrace digital transformation. A key to effective digital transformation is providing seamless experiences by breaking down the barriers between disparate systems.

Portal-heritage platforms like Liferay excel at integrating backend and legacy systems. These give customers, employees, and other end users access to the data they need across multiple applications within a company.

For example, customer data locked in a CRM or company’s marketing automation tool can be unified and shared easily through a portal-heritage DXP. This saves businesses and customers time and effort and helps companies better understand and support their target audience.

## Long-term Personalization & Authentication

While traditional CMS technology focuses on serving content to anonymous prospects, portals are designed to foster personalized connections between businesses and their target audiences. By providing secure interfaces and tailored experiences, portals enable companies to build lasting relationships and meet the specific needs of each individual user.

## Secure Data Handling Capabilities

Unlike CMSs, portals support large numbers of users and flows of information, often handling sensitive details from customers and businesses. Portal-heritage DXPs are founded in encrypted systems, ready to both store and analyze data for secure and insightful information management.

## Digital Agility

As highlighted by Gartner, portals can be used as a common architectural framework. Companies can build a website and quickly reuse the framework they have created to build more touchpoints. This can ensure that all their digital presences are uniform in functionality and appearance and saves time and money by avoiding a rebuild from scratch.

By turning a portal-heritage digital experience platform into a solutions factory, customers can quickly advance their digital strategies while maintaining control over the quality of individual experiences.

## Unparalleled Customizability

Liferay is recognized as the most flexible and extensible DXP available.

The approaches for tailoring and customizing Liferay have changed over time, with each step offering improved ease of use without sacrificing flexibility. Historically, the process for extending Liferay has evolved in these ways:

* Modifying the source
* EXT environment
* Plugins SDK
* Extension Points
* Client Extensions

### Evolution of Extensions

Initially users customizing Liferay built the product from source code, and could change anything. This ultimate flexibility cost users by potentially introducing their own bugs, and it was hard to upgrade easily to newer versions.

Each step forward reduced the knowledge needed to extend the platform while reducing the likelihood of introducing issues. The EXT Environment customized Liferay by overlaying user code on top of Liferay code. This kept user code separate from Liferay's code, but had many of the same drawbacks as modifying the source directly. The Plugins SDK came next, keeping customizations to installable files that changed Liferay's behavior at run time.

Liferay DXP 7.0 introduced OSGi. This moved customizations to a modular model, keeping them in a "container" that isolated them from core Liferay code and allowing them to communicate via Extension Points. For example, developers could implement new payment methods or order rules in the Commerce context, or new storage mechanisms for storing Documents and Media.

All of these improvements, however, still made upgrades challenging. The latest step in this process is the introduction of Client Extensions as our most powerful and maintainable extension mechanism. Client Extensions run separately from the core Liferay code, supporting easy upgrades and enabling Liferay DXP to be delivered using SaaS, PaaS, and Self-Hosted deployment approaches.

## Delivering Experiences for Many Audiences and Use Cases

Many DXP vendors focus primarily on consumer-based solutions such as public websites. Liferay’s portal heritage enables us to focus additionally on business-based solutions requiring authenticated experiences combining data and functionality from multiple systems.

Example business-focused authenticated solutions include

* Customer Portals
* Supplier Portals
* Partner Portals
* Intranet Solutions

Of course, this is far from a complete list.

All of these solutions feature inherent complexity in requirements and integration needs. By focusing on solutions that can handle this complexity, Liferay helps our customers to save time and reduce errors, and to address business-to-business (B2B), business-to-employee (B2E), government-to-citizen (G2C), government-to-business (G2B) as well as many of the most common B2C use cases as well.

Congratulations! You have completed this module on Liferay's unique selling points.
