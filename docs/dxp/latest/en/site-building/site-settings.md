# Site Settings

After you [create a site](./sites/adding-a-site.md), customize it to meet your needs and the needs of your users. A wealth of configuration options and tools are available to create the site you envision. Through the Site Menu, access these settings to configure every aspect of the site, from the name to the analytics services. Define default permissions for users, set the default language for the site, and more.
