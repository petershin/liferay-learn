    Liferay's first major new course of content is now live! The Building Enterprise Websites with Liferay represents the newest and most up-to-date baseline for understanding how to build solutions with Liferay DXP. This course takes learners through practical requirements, connects those requirements to Liferay concepts, and then provides step-by-step guidance for implementing a sample site. We have more plans to further enhance both the content of learn.liferay.com, this course, and of course many more courses to come!
