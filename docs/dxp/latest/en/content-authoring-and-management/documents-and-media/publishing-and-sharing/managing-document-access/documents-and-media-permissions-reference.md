# Documents and Media Permissions Reference

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 U76+/GA76+`

Manage access to Documents and Media assets using [application](#general-permissions) and [resource](#resource-permissions) permissions. With role-based access control, you can ensure only the intended users can create, view, download, and manage documents.

You can grant these permissions in the Roles application under Content & Data in the permissions side panel.

![Grant Documents and Media permissions in the Roles application under Content & Data in the permissions side panel.](./documents-and-media-permissions-reference/images/01.png)

Alternatively, you can assign individual resource permissions in the Documents and Media application.

![Assign individual resource permissions in the Documents and Media application.](./documents-and-media-permissions-reference/images/02.png)

See [Defining Role Permissions](../../../../users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/defining-role-permissions.md) for more information.

## General Permissions

General permissions grant access to the Documents and Media application itself and do not grant [resource-related permissions](#resource-permissions).

{bdg-secondary}`{bdg-secondary}Liferay DXP 2024.Q3+/Portal 7.4 GA125+` When a document has restricted visibility, the Not Visible to Guest Users icon (![Not Visible to Guest Users icon](../../../../images/icon-password-policies.png)) appears next to the document's name. This happens in contexts such as List, Table, or Cards view modes, when editing the document, or when selecting a document to display it on a page.

!!! tip
    If the Not Visible to Guest Users icon does not appear after managing the view permission for documents in the Documents and Media application, try refreshing your page.

![Use the Not Visible to Guest Users icon to identify which documents have restrictions to their visibility.](./documents-and-media-permissions-reference/images/03.png)

## Resource Permissions

Resource permissions grant access to view and act on resources in the Documents and Media application. Some of these permissions are for [creating entities](#documents), while others are for acting on existing entities (e.g., [folders](#documents-folder), and [documents](#document)).

| View              | View documents. Users with this permission can view all document metadata (e.g., title, description, adaptive media images, previews, thumbnails) and anything defined in attached document types and metadata sets. |

!!! important
    For Liferay 7.4 U75/GA75 and earlier, users could download assets with the View permission. Starting with 7.4 U76/GA76, there is a separate Download permission for managing view and download access. During the upgrade, Liferay automatically assigns the download permission to roles with the View permission. By default, all users, including unauthenticated ones, can download files; to limit this, remove the download permission from specific roles.

    The View permission allows visibility of a document's metadata and file entry in Liferay but not its actual content. Conversely, the Download permission allows retrieving and viewing the full document content locally.

    For documents like images, viewing them in a browser requires downloading them to the local device, so the Download permission is necessary to view images online. Understanding these distinctions is essential for effective permission management and access control.
