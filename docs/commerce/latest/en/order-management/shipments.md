# Shipments

You can create *Shipments* when an order is in the [processing](./orders/processing-an-order.md) stage.

!!! note
    A single shipment may contain multiple orders, but the same account must create all the orders contained in the shipment.

To create a shipment,

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and go to *Commerce* &rarr; *Orders*.

1. Select an order that is in the *Processing* status.

1. Click *Create Shipment*.

   ![Click on Create Shipment for an order that is in the processing stage.](./shipments/images/01.png)

Once you create a shipment, you are taken to the Shipments page where you can manage shipments and finish processing the order.
