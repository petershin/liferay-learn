# Currencies Reference

Liferay comes with multiple currencies pre-configured for use out-of-the-box. Your store must have a primary currency enabled, to start processing orders.

To manage currencies, open the _Global Menu_ (![Applications Menu icon](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to _Commerce_ &rarr; _Currencies_.

| Code                         | Currency's 3 letter [ISO code](https://www.currency-iso.org/en/home/tables/table-a1.html)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Format Pattern               | Currencyâ€™s sign, the number of digits to come between commas, and which places are displayed. For example, in the format $###,##0.00 for US dollars, the places held by _0_ are always displayed (as 0 if no other digit is present) while the places held by _#_ are only displayed if occupied. A value of 0.01 in the above format would be displayed as $0.01. |
