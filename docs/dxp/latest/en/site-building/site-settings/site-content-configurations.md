# Site Content Configurations

Liferay offers a range of tools and settings to help you configure and optimize your site's content, including setting up the asset recycle bin, configuring content rating types, managing content sharing across sites, configuring geolocation for assets, and securing site documents.

## Configuring the Asset Recycle Bin for Sites

The recycle bin stores content and assets flagged for deletion before they are permanently removed from the system. This functionality can be enabled globally by default and configured on a per-site basis. For more details on enabling or disabling the recycle bin for a site, see [Configuring the Asset Recycle Bin for Sites](./site-content-configurations/configuring-the-asset-recycle-bin-for-sites.md).

## Configuring Content Rating Types

Content rating types can be represented by different icons or labels (like stacked stars, stars, and thumbs ups). You can configure these rating types for various applications, including Blogs, Comments, Documents and Media, Knowledge Base, Message Boards, Web Content, and Wiki. For more details on setting rating types, see [Configuring Content Rating Types](./site-content-configurations/configuring-content-rating-type.md).

## Managing Content Sharing Across Sites

Child sites can display content from parent sites, including web content structures, templates, document types, vocabularies and categories, application display templates, and data definitions. Content sharing settings can be configured at both the instance and site scope. For more details on configuring content sharing, see [Managing Content Sharing Across sites](./site-content-configurations/managing-content-sharing-across-sites.md).

## Configuring Geolocation for Assets

Geolocated assets can be displayed for documents, web content articles, DDL records, etc. Liferay provides options to [configure geolocation settings for assets](./site-content-configurations/configuring-geolocation-for-assets.md), including selecting maps API providers and providing API keys.

## Securing Site Documents Content

By default, your site's Documents and Media files and folders are not visible in the web server directory index. However, you can enable this setting to allow browsing of documents through the web server directory index. For more details on securing site documents content, see [Securing Site Documents Content](./site-content-configurations/securing-site-documents-content.md).
