# Liferay Commerce Connector to PayPal SDK

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q4+/Portal 7.4 GA129+`

Liferay now provides a client extension that integrates with the [PayPal JavaScript SDK](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/reference/) to provide more payment options like Google Pay, Apple Pay, Venmo, Pay Later, etc. during checkout. This uses the payment integration client extension as a base.

Liferay also provides PayPal as a payment method out-of-the-box. This redirects the user to PayPal to complete payment whereas the new SDK processes the payment without the user having to navigate away from Liferay. See [Configuring Payment Methods](../configuring-payment-methods.md) to read more about the payment methods available out-of-the-box with Liferay.

!!! note
    Currently, the PayPal SDK client extension is only compatible with Liferay SaaS.

To use this client extension, you must have a merchant ID and also generate a PayPal client ID and client secret. Visit the [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/create) for more information.
