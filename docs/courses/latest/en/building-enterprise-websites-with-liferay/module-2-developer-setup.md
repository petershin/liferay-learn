<!--TODO: This introduction will probably need to be updated to transition more smoothly from the last section of Module 1, "Building Clarity on Liferay"-->

Liferay provides a variety of tools to streamline development and help you deliver better digital experiences. In the previous module, you learned about Clarity's business needs and how Liferay can address them. This module will introduce you to Liferay Workspace and Client Extensions, two key features for building applications with Liferay. While you won't be developing any extensions for Clarity just yet, you will have your workspace ready to go before you continue the course.
