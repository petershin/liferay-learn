# Security

Manage users while ensuring data compliance and the security of your digital environment. Liferay DXP is built with security in mind. This includes mitigation of common security vulnerabilities and exploits. Robust identity management and security tools ensure that users get access to the content and services they need, organizations adhere to data privacy regulations, and sites are protected from potential security threats.
