# Module 8: Headless APIs

!!! important "Webinar Note"
    This module was presented using slides for a live webinar audience. The formatting, presentation, and examples may differ from what is presented here as part of the course.

In the previous modules, you learned about building site pages and creating site content with Liferay in the context of Clarity's enterprise marketing website. Because creating new content requires significant effort, Clarity wants to import some of the existing content from their previous portal application so they can get up and running faster. Migrating legacy content is one of many use cases solved by Liferay's Headless APIs.

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to

* Use Headless APIs to migrate data between Liferay and external systems
* Create custom APIs with Liferay Objects using features like REST Builder and API Builder
* Secure API calls with OAuth 2.0

Before you get started, let's review Clarity's business requirements for Headless APIs.
