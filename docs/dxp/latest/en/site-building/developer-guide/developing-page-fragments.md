Page fragments are flexible, reusable components that you can drag and drop to build content pages and templates, including masters, pages, and display pages. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they add both structure and functionality to your layouts.

In this guide, learn how to develop custom fragments, use the Fragments Editor, and add configuration options to extend fragment functionality. You can also explore best practices, styling, and methods for automating fragment deployment, ensuring your fragments are optimized for a variety of use cases.
