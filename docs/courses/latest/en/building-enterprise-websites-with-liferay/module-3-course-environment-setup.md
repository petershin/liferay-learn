Liferay provides a variety of tools to streamline site and application development to deliver engaging digital experiences. In the previous module you explored Liferay's deployment approaches and determined which one is the best fit for Clarity Vision Solutions. Next you'll set up your local developer environment. While this isn't the first step for most of Clarity's employees, it is important for Clarity's IT team and necessary for completing this course's exercises.

!!! note
    This module explores more technical topics than the rest of this course. So if you’re not a developer, don’t worry; we won’t be spending too much time talking about these developer tools later on.

Here you'll set up the local Liferay environment you'll use throughout the course to build Clarity's enterprise website. You'll also learn about Liferay workspaces and client extensions, two essential features for building custom Liferay solutions.
