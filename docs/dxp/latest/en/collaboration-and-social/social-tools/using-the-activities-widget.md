# Using the Activities Widget

!!! note
    The Activities widget is [deprecated](../../installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/reference/maintenance-mode-and-deprecations-in-7-4.md) as of Liferay 2024.Q4+ and is scheduled for removal in a future release.

The *Activities* widget is used to track user activities on a site.

1. Drag and drop the *Activities* widget to the desired position on the page.

   ![Using an Activities widget on a page, you can see all the activities performed by all users.](./using-the-activities-widget/images/03.png)

Each item listed in the widget contains a link to the user and the asset (for example, a *Message Boards* post, or a wiki page). Clicking on the user redirects to the person's profile.

![If you click on the users' names, you are redirected to their profiles.](./using-the-activities-widget/images/04.png)

Clicking on the link redirects to the site page where the asset is located.

Lastly, click *RSS* to subscribe to the user activities.
