# Creating Form Templates

!!! important
    Dynamic Data Lists is deprecated as of Liferay DXP 7.3, and is planned for removal in 2024. It is replaced by [Objects](../../../liferay-development/objects.md). Please [migrate](./migrating-to-liferay-objects.md) your Dynamic Data Lists to Objects as soon as possible.

Form Templates control how the data entry form appears for a data definition. To create a new Form Template,

1. Navigate to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Dynamic Data Lists*. 

1. Click the Options icon (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) at the top-right and click *Manage Data Definitions*.

1. In the list of data definitions click the definition's Actions icon (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and click *Manage Templates*.

1. Click the *Add* icon (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) and click *Add Form Template*.

1. Give your template a name, then expand the Details section and give it a description. 

    ![Give your template a name and configure the form.](./creating-form-templates/images/01.png)

1. Scroll down to the graphical designer in the View tab, and make your desired changes. For example, you can move or delete fields, change field labels, and more.

1. Click *Save* when you’re finished.

Alternatively, you can create Form Templates from the Dynamic Data Lists Display widget:

1. Follow the instructions in the [Creating Data List](./creating-data-lists.md) article for adding and configuring the widget in a Site page. Make sure to configure the widget to show the list you’re creating a template for.

1. Click the widget’s *Add Form Template* link. This opens the same form as above for creating a form template for the list’s definition.
