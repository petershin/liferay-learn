# Site Building

Sites are a fundamental component of Liferay DXP. At its core, a Site is a collection of pages that contains content. Sites can also contain applications that provide additional functionality for the page---many are available for you to use out-of-the-box. Liferay DXP includes powerful features that you can use to streamline the Site creation process and create rich and personalized experiences for users. To learn more about Site Building with Liferay, read [Getting Started With Site Building](./site-building/getting-started-with-site-building.md).
