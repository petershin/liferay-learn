# Subscribing to a Message Board

Users can receive email updates and in-product notifications by subscribing to a message board. By default, users are subscribed automatically to any threads they create and can opt in to subscribe to categories or specific threads via email or RSS feed.

## Subscribing to a Category or Thread

1. On the *Message Boards* widget (on a site page), click *Actions* (![Actions icon](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to a category/thread (in this example, *Category 1*).

1. Click *Subscribe*.

   ![Use the subscribe action to subscribe to a category/thread.](./subscribing-to-a-message-board/images/01.png)

The user has now subscribed to *Category 1*. The user is notified of any changes, such as new threads and subcategories being created under *Category 1*.

To see which categories and threads you have subscribed to:

1. On the *Message Boards* widget, select the *My Subscriptions* tab.

## Subscribing using RSS Feeds

Message Boards can be published as [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds. RSS for *Message Boards* are enabled by default and Liferay DXP supports RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, or Atom 1.0.
