# Liferay SaaS Compatibility Matrix

Liferay DXP is the heart of Liferay SaaS, but not every DXP feature applies to Liferay SaaS. Some DXP features are not compatible, and some must be achieved via other means.

Here is a list of common Liferay DXP features and their compatibility in Liferay SaaS.

| **Feature**                                               | **Liferay SaaS Compatibility**     | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Server Administration**                                 | Not Compatible                     | Server administration actions, including resource actions, Groovy script execution, custom log levels, and system settings, are not accessible. You can request some features via a Support ticket, such as performing a search reindex.                 |
| **Managing the Core Cloud Service Stack**                 | Not Compatible                     | The Liferay Cloud service stack (Liferay DXP, search, database, web server, and backup services) are managed directly by Liferay. This includes individual service versions, image versions, and environment backups.                                    |
| **Accessing Application Logs**                            | Compatible                         | Access application logs via your extension environment's *Log* tab, in the Liferay Cloud console. Submit a Support ticket for help resolving issues.                                                                                                     |
| **Groovy Script Execution**                               | Not Compatible                     | This can affect server administration, object actions, and workflows. Use [client extensions](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions) and remote extension points instead.                                    |
| **Deploying Custom OSGi modules**                         | Not Compatible                     | Use [client extensions](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions) and remote extension points instead.                                                                                                          |
| **Custom Liferay DXP Patch Levels**                       | Not Compatible                     | Liferay directly handles all patching responsibilities, including updates, hotfixes, and security patches.                                                                                                                                               |

They are limited to 5,000 calls per user, per hour.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Instance Settings**                                     | Compatible                         | Use [client extensions](https://learn.liferay.com/web/guest/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions/configuration-client-extensions#instance-settings-client-extensions) to modify instance settings per environment.                              |
| **Liferay DXP Portal Properties (portal-ext.properties)** | Limited Compatibility              | Many of these configurations can be changed in site or instance settings instead. You can request changes to some other portal properties by submitting a Support ticket.                                                                                |
| **Site Creation**                                         | Compatible (limited by plan quota) | Liferay DXP itself does not restrict the number of sites you can create, but Liferay SaaS subscription plans restrict the number of sites per customer.                                                                                                  |
| **Basic Auth Header - Authentication Verifier**           | Not Compatible                     | This authentication verifier is disabled for security purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Digest Header - Authentication Verifier**               | Not Compatible                     | This authentication verifier is disabled for security purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **WebDav**                                                | Not Compatible                     | WebDav uses basic or digest authentication, so it is also disabled for security purposes.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)**                                  | Compatible                         | Liferay SaaS is compatible with any identity provider (IdP) compliant with SAML 2.0.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Connecting Third-Party CDN Providers**                  | Not Compatible                     | Liferay SaaS has its own CDN. Third-party CDN providers (such as Cloudflare or Akamai) are not compatible.                                                                                                                                               |

Liferay SaaS is compatible with client-to-site VPNs using OpenVPN or IKEv2 protocols. This requires the "dedicated resources" add-on to your subscription.                   |
| **Self-Service Backups**                                  | Not Compatible                     | Liferay controls all backup operations for all Liferay SaaS instances. Customers cannot directly configure the backup routines or perform backup restores.                                                                                               |

| **Template Engines**                                      | Limited Compatibility              | These classes, methods, and variables are restricted: `java.lang.Class`, `java.lang.Thread`, `java.lang.System`, `serviceLocator`, `objectUtil`, `staticUtil`.                                                                                           |

| **SMTP (Mail) Server**                                    | Compatible                         | Liferay SaaS has its own SMTP mail server, and it can be connected to a custom SMTP provider.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Dynatrace**                                             | Not Compatible                     | Client extensions and client extension environments can be monitored by Dynatrace, but not Liferay SaaS itself. Using Dynatrace for client extension environments requires extra configuration. This is *not* included with a Liferay SaaS subscription. |
| **Solr**                                                  | Not Compatible                     | SaaS deployments use Elasticsearch. |
| **Cross-Cluster Replication**                             | Not Compatible                     | Cross-Cluster Replication requires system level configuration, which is not possible in SaaS environments. |
| **Learning to Rank**                                      | Not Compatible                     | Learning to Rank requires a plugin that is not installed in SaaS environments, and uses a system level configuration that is not configurable in SaaS environments. |
| **Search Monitoring**                                     | Not Compatible                     | Liferay's monitoring application requires Kibana, which is not installed in SaaS environments, and uses a system level configuration that is not configurable in SaaS environments. |
