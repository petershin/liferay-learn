**At a Glance**

* Liferay provides Battlecards for
  * The four main competitors covered in Level 0
  * Other vendors competed against regularly
  * MACH Alliance and Low-Code / No-Code offerings
* Additional Battlecards are being added over time

## Battlecard Summaries

This section contains a brief review of each of the currently available Battlecards. This is _not_ intended to be a deep-dive, please download the Battlecards themselves to view all of the details.

Acquia, Adobe, Optimizely and Sitecore are the [four main competitors](../../level-0/competitive-landscape-and-liferay-positioning.md) covered in the level 0 module.

### Acquia

* Acquia is a SaaS company that provides enterprise products, services, and technical support for the open-source web content management platform Drupal.
* Liferay shouldn’t fear Acquia at all unless the opportunity use case is a pure play CMS or B2C website.

### Adobe Experience Cloud

* Adobe deployments are of very high cost.
* Adobe does not have document management or collaboration capabilities.

### Optimizely

* Optimizely provides a SaaS DXP and is strong in B2C use cases.
* Episerver acquired Optimizely in 2021, and chose Optimizely as the rebranded name for both companies.
* Optimizely relies heavily on Forrester and Gartner reports to attract prospects.
* The offering is lacking in employee experience capabilities, is not intuitive for non-technical users, and lacks a robust user community.

### Sitecore

* Sitecore is a DXP focused on marketing driven opportunities.
* Gartner reports that some customers accumulate more technical debt from each version upgrade.
* Customers report limited out-of-the-box capabilities that require a lot of customization and hidden costs, as well as a lack of direct support to all customers.

In addition to the four main competitors faced by Liferay, there are Battlecards for several other organizations:

### HCL Technologies

* HCL Technologies is a multinational IT services and consulting company that offers HCL Digital Experience.
* IBM sold a number of the Websphere software products to HCL in 2019.
* To date there has been no word about any future development, despite support costs continuing to rise.
* Ultimately, HCL knows how to be a consulting and services company, not a product company.

### Magnolia

* Magnolia is a java-based, open-source CMS.
* Magnolia is primarily a CMS, not a true digital experience platform like Liferay.
* According to Gartner, Magnolia is now lacking in their “ability to execute” and “completeness of vision”.

### Open Source Drupal

* Another open source competitor is Drupal and more specifically Open Source Drupal is a “free” CMS written in PHP. Acquia DXP is based on Drupal.
* Drupal is known for trying to be “bigger and better” too fast instead of maintaining a solid foundation. Support is lacking (according to current customers), learning curve is steep, upgrades are notoriously difficult, and it can take months (or years!) for bugs to be fixed.

### Salesforce

* Salesforce Experience Cloud is a set of functionality acquired by and built on top of the Salesforce CRM platform, which allows companies to build digital experiences.
* Salesforce bought their way into the DXP market via 62 acquired organizations to date, so the offering is very fractured. For example they purchased Mulesoft because they didn't have a backend.
* Salesforce “gives products away” in order to get their foot in the door with a customer, and will expand their influence (and high costs) from there.

### Sharepoint

* Microsoft Sharepoint is a collaboration platform designed for the purpose of storing and managing documents and content. 
* Sharepoint doesn’t play well with others capabilities unless they are other Microsoft products. 
* There are no native B2B capabilities, pricing is high and complex, and apps are disconnected.

### Wordpress VIP

* Wordpress VIP is an agile content platform for the enterprise ecosystem.
* The Enterprise version of Wordpress lacks many of the advanced capabilities required of a DXP, even though it is positioned by Wordpress as a DXP.

### Oracle Service Cloud

* Oracle Service Cloud is an enterprise platform that has grown its capabilities through many acquisitions similar to many other competitors.
* There are high costs associated with little flexibility when it comes to customers’ needs.

### OutSystems

* OutSystems is a Low-Code development platform.
* Liferay has Low-Code / No-Code capabilities, but OutSystems themselves lack true digital experience platform capabilities and are not necessarily a direct competitor.
* This battlecard is taking the concept of a _pure_ low-code or no-code solution, and why we think that using a product like Liferay with low-code/no-code capabilities, but much more to offer in addition, could be a better solution to an organization’s problem.

### Low-Code / No-Code

This Battlecard summarizes some selling points against any Low-Code / No-Code software.

* The low-code/no-code modular approach lets developers quickly build applications by relieving them of the need to write code line by line. 
* It is important to remember that a DXP like Liferay with strong low-code / no-code capabilities is a much stronger proposition than a pure low-code / no code solution.
* The use of Low-Code/No-Code platforms has increased in order to support the digital transformation processes. 
* Low-Code development requires users to do some level of coding, albeit much less than is required with traditional application development. 
* No-Code development targets nontechnical users in various business functions who understand business needs and rules, but possess little or no coding experience and programming language skills. 
* Liferay is not a Low-Code Platform, it is a true DXP with Low Code capabilities.
* Liferay is investing heavily into adding Low-Code / No-Code capabilities like Objects.
* When competing against a pure-play Low-Code / No-Code platform avoid direct comparisons as they will not be like-for-like.

### MACH Alliance

* MACH Alliance is not a competitor, but it is an umbrella organization for technologies that are:
  * Microservices based
  * API first
  * Cloud native
  * Headless
* Liferay can accommodate these needs and aspirations well, but the full DXP offers much greater value than a pure MACH stack.
* MACH advocates that companies should be able to pick and choose the top solutions from top vendors to build an incredible stack.
* Liferay is well aligned with MACH philosophy and features of a MACH platform, and provides many of the features and benefits of MACH, but Liferay advocates the use of one platform. A key point is that a MACH stack will require a UI to be developed from scratch, while Liferay provides a rich UI that can be extended easily with many of the same benefits.

### SAP Hybris

* SAP Hybris is an e-commerce platform with origins in product management and master data management. 
* Liferay's portal capabilities well exceed those of SAP Hybris. 
* SAP integrates well with _other_ SAP products, but it is difficult to integrate with other systems.  Since very few companies use SAP exclusively this can create significant challenges.

### Bloomreach

* Bloomreach looks to serve digital commerce and marketing professionals seeking to transform the way they manage commerce experiences across all touchpoints.
* Bloomreach is _mainly_ focused on digital commerce oriented use cases for B2C and B2B markets
* Bloomreach recently rebranded itself and goes to market as a “commerce experience platform.” 
* Caution may be required when customers try to use Bloomreach in non-transactional scenarios.

### ShopifyPlus

* ShopifyPlus is a user-friendly and scalable enterprise e-commerce platform for high volume merchants
* ShopifyPlus has evolved from the consumer-focused Shopify application
* Shopify is a best fit for digital businesses that need a quick, light, and usable solution
* ShopifyPlus has significant functional limitations compared with true enterprise platforms
