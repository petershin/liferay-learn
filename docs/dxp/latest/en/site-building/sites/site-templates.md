# Site Templates

Liferay provides site templates for designing structures and content that you can use during site creation. Each template includes most standard site applications for adding pages, style books, web content, and more. Sites created with a template inherit all of its data. See [Creating Site Templates](./site-templates/creating-site-templates.md) for more information.

!!! note
    Site templates support all site applications except staging, workflow, memberships, teams, and segments.

Once you've created a site using a template, you can make changes to the template's pages and automatically propagate those changes to connected sites. See [Propagating Template Changes](./site-templates/propagating-template-changes.md) for more information.

!!! important
    Site templates are primarily intended for maintaining pages across multiple sites. If you must create and maintain web content and other assets across sites, use [asset libraries](../../content-authoring-and-management/asset-libraries.md).
