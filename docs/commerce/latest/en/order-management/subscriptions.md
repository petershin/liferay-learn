# Subscriptions

Subscriptions are recurring orders managed differently from [regular orders](./orders/processing-an-order.md). All orders, including subscriptions, are accepted and processed in the [Orders Menu](./orders/orders-menu-reference-guide.md). However, after accepting a *Subscription* order, it appears in the [Subscriptions menu](./subscriptions/subscription-administration-reference-guide.md).
