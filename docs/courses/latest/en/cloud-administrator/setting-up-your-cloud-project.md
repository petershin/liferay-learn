# Setting Up Your Cloud Project

After you have either an instance of Liferay SaaS or PaaS provisioned, your first task is to access the cloud console.

In Liferay PaaS (self-managed), you use the cloud console to manage each of your environment's services, including the [web server](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/platform-services/web-server-service) and [database](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/platform-services/database-service/database-service).

In Liferay SaaS, these services are managed for you, and you work primarily with Liferay's out-of-the-box features, but you still use the console to manage your own [client extensions](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/building-applications/client-extensions).

Here, you'll learn how to 

- Log into the cloud console for the first time
- Navigate the cloud console
- Invite other team members to access the cloud console
- Install and use a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to access your account from your computer

Next you'll help Delectable Bonsai's IT staff, Marcus and Kyle, to access the cloud console and acquire [the tools that you'll need](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool) to deploy changes to your Cloud project.
