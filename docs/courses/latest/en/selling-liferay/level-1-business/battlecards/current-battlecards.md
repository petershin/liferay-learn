## Battlecard Summaries

The session on [Competitive Landscape and Liferay Positioning](../../level-0/competitive-landscape-and-liferay-positioning.md) covered the four categories that Liferay's competitors are grouped into: Low Code Application Platforms (LCAP), Composable Point Solutions (CPS), Digital Experience Platforms (DXP), and Enterprise Suites.

This section contains a brief review of each of the currently available Battlecards. This is _not_ intended to be a deep-dive, please download the Battlecards themselves to view all of the details.

### Acquia

* Acquia is a SaaS company that provides enterprise products, services, and technical support for the open-source web content management platform Drupal.
* Acquia Experience Platform is built around Drupal to allow companies to build, operate, and optimize their digital experiences.
* Acquia's main focus and strengths are in CMS and B2C website solution use cases.
* Liferay continues to be stronger in B2B and B2E Experience use cases, according to the latest report from Gartner.

### Optimizely

* Optimizely provides a SaaS DXP and is strong in B2C use cases.
* Episerver acquired Optimizely in 2021, and chose Optimizely as the rebranded name for both companies.
* Optimizely is one of the toughest vendors to compete against. However, with effective sales execution it is possible to win against Optimizely.

### Sitecore

* Sitecore is a DXP focused on marketing driven opportunities.
* Customers report limited out-of-the-box capabilities that require a lot of customization and hidden costs, as well as a lack of direct support to all customers.
* Personalization with Liferay extends beyond targeting content (Sitecore is primarily a CMS) and includes all engagements, interactions, and transactions not based on a content interaction.

### HCL Technologies

* HCL Technologies is a multinational IT services and consulting company that offers HCL Digital Experience.
* IBM sold a number of the Websphere software products to HCL in 2019.
* Liferay is the clear alternative for organizations that currently have IBM Websphere Portal and are experiencing the pain of rising costs, potential disruption in support and the possibility of discontinued future development.
* Liferay can make the transition easy, providing organizations with a modern, reliable, secure, manageable and affordable infrastructure now and in the future, with the flexibility and customizability of Java-based open source code, out of the box applications, and Headless APIs.

Like Liferay, HCL Digital Experience (DX) platform is highly extensible, providing sector-specific use cases, integrations, and connectors for complex scenarios. Liferay competes head-to-head with HCL in complex enterprise accounts. HCL DX is the main DXP product that Liferay competes with, but HCL does have other competitive offerings:

* HCL Digital Experience (DXP): Easy content creation and management; Customizable, Templated Workflows; Asset Management; Portals and Sites; Extensive integrations; Cloud agnostic deployment; Data Security.
* HCL Commerce Cloud: Integrated and composable e-commerce platform for B2B,B2C, B2B2C, and D2C.
* HCL Unica, HCL Discover (Marketing & Automation): Marketing Automating, Personalized Campaigns; Gain customer behavior insights.
* HCL Volt MX (Low-Code Development): Multi-Experience Low-Code application development platform.
* HCL Customer Data Platform (CDP): Collects, stores, and manages customer data from various sources.

### Magnolia

* Magnolia is a Java-based, open-source CMS.
* Magnolia is primarily a CMS, not a true digital experience platform like Liferay.

### Wordpress VIP

* Wordpress VIP is an agile content platform for the enterprise ecosystem.
* The Enterprise version of Wordpress lacks many of the advanced capabilities required of a DXP, even though it is positioned by Wordpress as a DXP.

### Adobe Experience Cloud

* Adobe is an Enterprise Suite vendor covering a range of digital experience solutions under the umbrella of Adobe Experience Cloud.
* Adobe competes in most industries: Retail, Financial Services, Healthcare, High Tech, Manufacturing, Travel, Telco and more.
* Adobe is not seen as much in the public sector - probably because of their extremely high cost. 
* Adobe is guaranteed to be in the competition mix when the prospect is a large enterprise and when there is a large budget. 

Adobe Experience Cloud (AEC) is a suite of products designed to manage all aspects of customer experience (CX) across various touchpoints. It caters to marketing, commerce, and IT teams. Core components include:

* Adobe Experience Manager (AEM): A DXP for building and managing websites, mobile apps, and other digital experiences. AEM excels in content management and personalization. 
* Adobe Marketing Cloud (formerly Marketo): Marketing automation tools for campaign management, analytics, audience segmentation, and personalization.
* Adobe Analytics: Tools for website traffic analysis, customer journey tracking, and marketing attribution.
* Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento): A dedicated enterprise-grade eCommerce platform, which can be integrated with AEC.

### Salesforce

Salesforce is an Enterprise Suite, with a heritage in CRM, which features that include Sales, Service, and Marketing Cloud. 

Salesforce uses their platform (PaaS) and their marketplace to extend beyond CRM in areas like ERP (Financialforce), DXP (Experience Cloud), and Commerce (Demandware).

Liferay usually only competes with Salesforce if the customer already has Salesforce CRM deployed (vendor lock-in). Salesforce leads in CRM, according to analysts and will crosssell and upsell Experience Cloud (Portal) and Commerce where they see an opportunity.

Competitive offerings include:

* Salesforce Experience Cloud: Formerly known as Community Cloud, Salesforce Experience Cloud allows businesses to create connected digital experiences for their customers, partners and employees. This competes with Liferay DXP.
* Salesforce Commerce Cloud: Acquired from Demandware, Salesforce Commerce Cloud provides a comprehensive suite of capabilities to deliver a unified, personalized shopping experience across all digital channels. This competes with Liferay Commerce. 
* The Salesforce platform also offers a range of Low-Code development tools, including Salesforce Flow, Apps Development, and Experience Builder. This competes with Liferay's Low-Code capabilities. 

### Sharepoint

Microsoft is an Enterprise Suite vendor, providing the entire technology stack, including the IaaS (Azure), PaaS (Azure App Service & Power Platform) and SaaS (CRM and ERP Dynamics 365).

* Microsoft Sharepoint is a collaborations platform designed for the purpose of storing and managing documents and content.
* Sharepoint can be heavily customized, and as such is often used to build intranets and public websites , although it is not natively designed and equipped for both use cases (particularly the latter). 
* As part of Office 365, Sharepoint is omnipresent in many enterprises, but Sharepoint may also be purchased separately from the Office 365 suite.
Microsoft has different offerings for Sharepoint: 
* Sharepoint Online (Cloud): Part of the Microsoft 365 suite
* Sharepoint On-premise (EOL stated for July 2026, to be replaced by Subscription Edition)

Microsoft also competes with Liferay with their Power Platform and particularly Power Pages, which are both Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP).

### Oracle

* Oracle has created an Enterprise Application suite by acquiring 65 companies, integrated to create "Fusion Applications".
* Oracle's main focus is to cover end-to-end business processes, with a focus on ERP, with very little focus on CX, or Digital Experience.
* Oracle is no longer regarded as a DXP vendor according to Gartner.
* Liferay usually only competes with Oracle when an organization already has a big Oracle footprint, where Oracle already has vendor lock-in.

### SAP

* SAP is an Enterprise Suite vendor with a core focus and legacy in ERP. 
* SAP also offers CRM (Customer Experience) solutions. 
* SAP has a broad set of features in a monolithic architecture. 
* SAP is known for its pervasive installed base at the most complex B2B enterprises. 
* SAP Hybris was an e-commerce platform acquired by SAP in 2013, since rebranded it as SAP Commerce Cloud, but it has not evolved much since that time. 

SAP competes with Liferay in the following ways:
Focus of SAP Commerce Cloud: B2B & B2C Ecommerce: 
* SAP Commerce Cloud is an enterprise-grade platform designed for businesses to build and manage online stores for both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions.
* SAP Commerce Cloud offers features for product management, order processing, marketing automation, and customer service specific to the ecommerce realm.
* SAP also provides Enterprise Portals (SAP EP), which is the web front-end component for SAP NetWeaver (SAPÂ´s Application Platform). 
* SAP Enterprise Portal is nearing end-of-life and customers are recommended to migrate to the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

SAP is more focused on providing DXP capabilities as an extension of their ERP & CRM solutions, while Liferay caters to a broader range of digital experiences, regardless of ERP or CRM technologies in place. Liferay therefore only competes with SAP where SAP already has a large footprint at the customer. 

Instead of competing against SAP, in most cases Liferay integrates with SAP to provide best-of-breed Portal and CMS functionality.

### Low-Code / No-Code

* The Low-Code / No-Code modular approach lets developers quickly build applications by relieving them of the need to write code line by line. 
* It is important to remember that a DXP like Liferay with strong Low-Code / No-Code capabilities is a much stronger proposition than a pure Low-Code / No-Code solution.
* The use of Low-Code / No-Code platforms has increased in order to support the digital transformation processes. 
* Low-Code development requires users to do some level of coding, albeit much less than is required with traditional application development. 
* No-Code development targets nontechnical users in various business functions who understand business needs and rules, but possess little or no coding experience and programming language skills. 
* Liferay is not a Low-Code Platform, it is a true DXP with Low-Code capabilities.
* Liferay is investing heavily into extending Low-Code / No-Code capabilities like Objects.

### ServiceNow

* ServiceNow started as an IT Service Management platform, but has evolved into a Low-Code Application Platform (LCAP).
* ServiceNow includes AppEngine, a Low-Code development suite. This LCAP functionality allows for rapid development and deployment of workflows to automate tasks across the enterprise, not just IT-related ones.

ServiceNow is not primarily considered a DXP, however it does offer some features that might be relevant for a DXP strategy.  ServiceNow limited DXP Functionality includes:

* Employee Experience: ServiceNow focuses more on internal portals than public-facing customer experiences. However, it can improve employee experience through features like self-service portals for requesting IT services, accessing knowledge bases, and managing workflows.
* Content Management: ServiceNow offers some content management capabilities for internal content like knowledge base articles or employee onboarding materials. But it is not on equivalent to dedicated DXPs for managing complex websites.
* Low-Code Development: ServiceNow's AppEngine allows creating custom applications for internal use. LCAP and Servicenow's integration capabilities are the only areas where ServiceNow really directly competes with Liferay. Applications built with AppEngine can leverage ServiceNow's integrations to connect with external data sources to allow tasks and processes that involve data from various systems to be automated.

### ShopifyPlus

* ShopifyPlus is a user-friendly and scalable enterprise e-commerce platform for high volume merchants.
* ShopifyPlus has evolved from the consumer-focused Shopify application.
* Shopify is a best fit for digital businesses that need a quick, light, and usable solution.
* ShopifyPlus has significant functional limitations compared with true enterprise platforms

### Contentful

* Contentful is a flexible and future-friendly content platform that helps editors to manage and developers to serve content into mobile or web applications.
* Despite being one of the fastest growing brands in the market, Contentful has certain limitations for sites that require high levels of customization, especially e-commerce.
