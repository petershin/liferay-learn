# Prospecting Tools - Phone

The second tool that every seller must learn to master is the phone. Yes, cold calling. Despite the fear that this phrase raises in sales team members, and the propaganda about cold calling on sites like LinkedIn, cold calling is not dead!

## Common Mistakes

The most common mistakes made when phoning prospects are

* Not making enough calls
* Not leaving voicemails
* Calling from a foreign number
* Calling on a public holiday
* Calling several times on the same day
* Not preparing well enough

### Not Making Enough Calls

Most callers are not persistent enough with their prospect over the phone. For example, according to [ZoomInfo](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/sales/sales-follow-up-statistics) “95% of all converted leads are reached by the sixth call attempt. Yet 40% of sellers stop after 2 calls.”

### Not Leaving Voicemails

According to [Salesloft](https://salesloft.com/resources/blog/5-prospect-channels-your-sales-process-needs/), “Voicemail immediately followed by an email have reported a 10% increase in email conversions.”

The purpose of leaving voicemails is not to receive a phone call back; rather, you should leave your prospect voicemails to improve your reply rate on email.

### Example Voicemail

The following example good voicemail to a prospect could sound like

> "James, there's no need for you to call me back. I'm about to hit 'send’ on an email to you with the subject line 'Checking In’. You can respond with what day and time works best for you. Talk soon. This is Matt Wawro with Liferay."

The structure of this message, and indeed emails that are sent, must necessarily vary in different countries due to cultural differences. For example, in many European countries people may not want to be addressed using their first names when the contact is from a stranger. A better alternative might be to say “Hi” or “Good Morning” or even be more formal and use the surname with appropriate salutation.

### Other Common Mistakes

Other common mistakes include calling from a foreign number, which is an almost guaranteed way to not be answered. If your prospect is in another country and indeed that country is a target market for you, then the best outcome is to obtain a local number from that country. 

For the prospect it is also annoying to be called multiple times in a single day from the same number. While it might get the phone answered eventually, it will not be because the person wants to hear your message.

Even more annoying for the prospect is to get called on the weekend or on a public holiday.

Finally, you must be prepared so that if the call is answered you have a message that resonates with the prospect.

## Examples of Effective Phone Messaging 

What follows are examples of effective phone messaging:

* **Increase Profitability** \
Decreasing Cost-to-Serve leads to increased profits
* **Aligning Sales & Service** \
A single, comprehensive view of your customer drives success
* **Boost Customer Satisfaction** \
Satisfaction is a key component of customer loyalty

Much like email messaging, it is critical to lead with a clear offer of value, which can be done by highlighting one of the many challenges that customers can use Liferay to solve.

### Increasing Profitability

Some examples of this might be offering to increase the prospect’s profitability by facilitating digital self-service and decreasing cost-to-serve by utilizing tools designed to help doing that.

### Align Sales and Service

Another avenue to explore is to offer to align the Sales and Service teams by providing a single comprehensive view of customers. Liferay excels at building these types of experiences.

### Boost Customer Satisfaction

Finally, it’s usually cheaper to keep existing customers than to attract new ones. For this reason, most companies are interested in boosting their customer satisfaction. Liferay-based solutions have plenty of features to help make organizations easier to do business with and drive customer loyalty.

### Other tips for effective Phone Messaging

Whatever approach you take regarding business problems that Liferay can address, there are some fundamental steps that make phone messaging more effective

* **Allow your prospect to respond** \
Even when following a two-minute-long script, have short well thought-out sentences and questions and natural pauses between those sentences. Learning their needs is impossible if the prospect isn’t given the opportunity to talk.
* **Smile** \
Even though there’s clearly no visual aspect to a phone call, the person at the other end hears if you are smiling and warm and empathetic. They also hear if you are insecure or even worse, bored.
