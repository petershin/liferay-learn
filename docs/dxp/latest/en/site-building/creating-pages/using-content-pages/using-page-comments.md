# Using Page Comments

When building content pages, you and your team can collaborate using Liferay's page comments feature. Comments are enabled out of the box in Liferay DXP 7.3+.

## Adding Page Comments

1. Navigate to a content page that includes page elements (e.g., fragments or widgets) and click *Edit* (![Edit Button](../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) to begin editing the page.

1. Open the *Comments* panel (![Comments Icon](../../../images/icon-comments-w.png)) from the sidebar, and select fragment or widget where you'd like to add a comment.

   Alternatively, you can select the desired page element and click *Comments*. This opens the Comments panel.

   !!! note
       Comments cannot be added to [fragment sub-elements](../page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments/configuring-fragments/fragment-sub-elements-reference.md), containers, or grids.

1. Enter your comment in the side panel and click *Comment*.

Once added, you can edit or delete the comment via its *Actions* menu(![Actions menu](../../../images/icon-actions.png)). Users can also reply to comments.

!!! note
    Deleting a comment also removes all its replies.

## Reviewing Page Comments

After comments are added to a fragment or widget, you can review them in the comments side panel.

To mark a comment as resolved, click *Resolve* (![Resolve Button](../../../images/icon-resolve.png)). Resolved comments and their replies are hidden by default, but you can view them by checking *Show Resolved Comments*.

You can reopen a resolved comment by clicking *Resolve* again.
