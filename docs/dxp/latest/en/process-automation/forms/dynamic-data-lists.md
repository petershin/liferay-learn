# Dynamic Data Lists

!!! important
    Dynamic Data Lists is deprecated as of Liferay DXP 7.3, and is planned for removal in 2024. It is replaced by [Objects](../../liferay-development/objects.md). Please [migrate](./dynamic-data-lists/migrating-to-liferay-objects.md) your Dynamic Data Lists to Objects as soon as possible.
