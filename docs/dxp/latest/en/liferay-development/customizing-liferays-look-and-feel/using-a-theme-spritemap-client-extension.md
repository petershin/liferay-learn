# Using a Theme Sprite Map Client Extension

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4 2023.Q4+/GA100+`

With a theme sprite map client extension, you can override the default [Clay](https://clayui.com/docs/components/icon.html) sprite map used for icons on a page. Start with the [sample workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace) to build and deploy your client extension.

```{note}
An SVG sprite map is an image that contains several icons grouped together, each with a unique ID. You can load the SVG and reference the individual icons by ID. This provides a slight performance improvement, as you can download and cache the sprite map once to display all the site icons.
```

## Prerequisites

To start developing client extensions,

1. Install a [supported version of Java](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-Quarterly-Releases-Compatibility-Matrix).

    ```{note}
    Check the [compatibility matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411310034829-Liferay-DXP-7-4-Compatibility-Matrix) for supported JDKs, databases, and environments. See [JVM Configuration](../../installation-and-upgrades/reference/jvm-configuration.md) for recommended JVM settings.
    ```

1. Download and unzip the sample workspace:

   ```bash
   curl -o com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/content\?r\=liferay-public-releases\&g\=com.liferay.workspace\&a\=com.liferay.sample.workspace\&\v\=LATEST\&p\=zip
   ```

   ```bash
   unzip com.liferay.sample.workspace-latest.zip
   ```

Now you have the tools to deploy your first theme sprite map client extension.

## Examine the Theme Sprite Map Project

The theme sprite map client extension is in the sample workspace's `client-extensions/liferay-sample-theme-spritemap-1/` folder. It is defined in the `client-extension.yaml` file:

```yaml
liferay-sample-theme-spritemap-1:
    name: Liferay Sample Theme Spritemap 1
    type: themeSpritemap
    url: spritemap.svg
```

The client extension has the ID `liferay-sample-theme-spritemap-1` and contains the key configurations for a theme sprite map client extension, including the type and the sprite map file to add. See the [Theme Sprite Map YAML Configuration Reference](./using-a-theme-spritemap-client-extension/theme-sprite-map-yaml-configuration-reference.md) for more information on the available properties.

It also contains the `assemble` YAML block:

```yaml
assemble:
    - from: assets
      into: static
```

This specifies that everything in the `assets/` folder should be included as a static resource in the built client extension `.zip` file. The SVG sprite map in a theme sprite map client extension is used as a static resource in Liferay.

```{important}
The sample project's `assets/spritemap.svg` is a copy of the [Clay icons](https://clayui.com/docs/components/icon.html) sprite map used in Liferay. You won't notice any changes in the UI as all the icons used in Liferay are present in the example sprite map.

Since a sprite map client extension replaces the entire sprite map on the selected page, make sure that you have all the necessary icons with their corresponding IDs to avoid missing icons.
```

## Modify the Sprite Map

To change a specific icon, you must find the ID of the icon. You can inspect the HTML element to find this.

![The navbar contains nine icons.](./using-a-theme-spritemap-client-extension/images/01.png)

Given below are the IDs of the icons used on the top navbar.

| Number | Icon                                                                          | ID                     |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 1      | ![Edit icon](../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)                         | pencil                 |
| 2      | ![Cog icon](../../images/icon-cog.png)                                  | cog                    |
| 3      | ![Simulation icon](../../images/icon-simulation.png)                    | simulation-menu-closed |
| 4      | ![Analytics icon](../../images/icon-analytics.png)                      | analytics              |
| 5      | ![AB Testing icon](../../images/icon-ab-testing.png)                    | test                   |
| 6      | ![Information icon](./using-a-theme-spritemap-client-extension/images/02.png) | info-circle            |
| 7      | ![Global Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)            | grid                   |
| 8      | ![Search icon](./using-a-theme-spritemap-client-extension/images/03.png)      | search                 |
| 9      | ![User icon](./using-a-theme-spritemap-client-extension/images/04.png)        | user                   |

To swap the pencil icon for a fish,

1. Find the `<symbol>` tag corresponding to the ID of `pencil` inside `assets/spritemap.svg`. You must open the SVG file in a text editor to view this.

   ```html
   <symbol id="pencil" viewBox="0 0 512 512">

2. Replace this with a custom icon and give it the same ID (`pencil`). Use the below `symbol` for a fish icon.

   ```html
   <symbol id="pencil" viewBox="0 26 100 48">
      <path d="M98.5,47.5C96.5,45.5,81,35,62,35c-2.1,0-4.2,0.1-6.2,0.3L39,26c0,4.5,1.3,9,2.4,12.1C31.7,40.7,23.3,44,16,44L0,34

   </symbol>
   ```

## Deploy the Sprite Map Client Extension

```{include} /_snippets/run-liferay-portal.md
```

Next, run this command from the client extension project's folder in the sample workspace:

```bash
../../gradlew clean deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
```

This builds your client extension and deploys the zip to Liferay's `deploy/` folder.

```{note}
To deploy your client extension to Liferay SaaS, use the Liferay Cloud [Command-Line Tool](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool) to run [`lcp deploy`](https://learn.liferay.com/w/liferay-cloud/reference/command-line-tool#deploying-to-your-liferay-cloud-environment).
```

```{tip}
To deploy all client extensions in the workspace simultaneously, run the command from the `client-extensions/` folder.
```

Confirm the deployment in your Liferay instance's console:

```bash
STARTED liferay-sample-theme-spritemap-1_1.0.0
```

## Use the New Sprite Map on a Page

Configure a page to use your deployed client extension:

1. Go to the page, then click _Edit_ (![Edit icon](../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) at the top.

1. In the sidebar, navigate to the Page Design Options menu (![Page Design Options icon](../../images/icon-format.png)) and click _Configuration_ (![Configuration icon](../../images/icon-cog3.png)) at the top of the menu.

1. In the Theme Sprite Map Client Extension section, click _Add_ (![Add](../../images/icon-duplicate.png)).

1. Select the newly deployed sprite map, _Liferay Sample Theme Spritemap 1_.

   ![Select the Liferay Sample Theme Spritemap 1 client extension and click Save.](./using-a-theme-spritemap-client-extension/images/05.gif)

1. Scroll down and click _Save_.

1. Go back to the page. In the navbar, a fish icon has replaced the pencil (![Edit icon](../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) for the edit functionality.

![The new icon from the sprite map appears on the navbar.](./using-a-theme-spritemap-client-extension/images/06.png)
