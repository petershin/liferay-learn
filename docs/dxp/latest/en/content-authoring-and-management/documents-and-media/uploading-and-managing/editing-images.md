# Editing Images

Liferay's Documents and Media includes a built-in image editor for cropping and rotating images without switching contexts.

To use the image editor, open Documents and Media, click *Actions* (![Actions Button](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the desired image, and select *Edit Image*.

When editing an image in Documents and Media, you have these options:

**Crop**: Manually adjust the cropping frame; click and drag the image to reposition it within the cropping frame.

**Ratio**: Select a fixed preset ratio for cropping the image (i.e., 16:10, 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 2:3), or select *Free* to create a custom image ratio.

**Rotate**: Rotate image clockwise.

**Zoom**: Adjust image zoom without changing aspect ratio; maximum zoom is 200% and minimum is 12.5%.

**Cancel**: Undo all unsaved changes and exit image edit mode.

**Save**: Save all changes made to the image; this overwrites the existing image file.
