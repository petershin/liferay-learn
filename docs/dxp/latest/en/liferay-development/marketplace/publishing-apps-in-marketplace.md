# Publishing Apps in Marketplace

The Liferay Marketplace contains both Cloud apps (for Liferay SaaS, PaaS, and self-hosted) and DXP apps (for Liferay PaaS and Liferay Self-Hosted). As a publisher, you may want to publish your apps on the Marketplace. The process of publishing a DXP app differs slightly from that of Cloud apps. If you haven't signed up to become a publisher, see [Become a Publisher](./become-a-publisher.md) for more information.

## Overview

The publishing process for both DXP and Cloud applications involves a 9-step process.
