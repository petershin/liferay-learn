# Audit Framework

Liferay's audit framework shows activities relating to users, user groups, organizations, roles, multi-factor authentication, and objects (definitions, fields, actions, layouts, relationships, validations, and views) on your instance. You can access it by opening the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigating to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Audit*. The application displays a searchable list of captured events. You can click on an event for more information, browse or search through the list, or export audit events to CSV. With the audit framework, you can quickly find out what changes were made on your Liferay instance and by whom. If you delegated permission granting to any group of people, this is an essential feature you're likely to use.
