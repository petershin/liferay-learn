# Styling Widgets

Once you've added widgets on a page, you can customize the look and feel of the widgets to meet your needs. With a range of configuration options available, you can tailor the widgets to match your site's branding, adjust the layout and placement of the widgets, and even customize the functionality and behavior of the widgets to better suit your users' needs.
