# Product Types

Commerce Catalogs provides four out-of-the-box product types: Simple, Grouped, Virtual, and Diagram.

**[Simple product](./product-types/creating-a-simple-product.md)**: Any physical product for which inventory is tracked.

**[Grouped product](./product-types/creating-a-grouped-product.md)**: Two or more products from the Catalog that are packaged together and sold as a single item. Grouped products are tracked in your inventory and can contain simple products, other grouped products, or virtual products.

**[Virtual products](./product-types/creating-a-virtual-product.md)**: Any non-tangible product, such as music files, electronic publications, services, and warranties.

**[Shop by Diagram](./product-types/shop-by-diagram.md)**: These are component parts belonging to a Bill of Materials (BOM) diagram that reference products in the store.
