# Site Content Configurations

Liferay offers a range of tools and settings to help you configure and optimize your site's content: 

- Setting up the asset recycle bin 
- Configuring content rating types 
- Managing content sharing across sites 
- Configuring geolocation for assets 
- Securing site documents

## Configuring the Asset Recycle Bin for Sites

The recycle bin stores content and assets flagged for deletion before they are removed permanently from the system. [You can enable this globally by default and configure it on a per-site basis](./site-content-configurations/configuring-the-asset-recycle-bin-for-sites.md).

## Configuring Content Rating Types

Users can rate content in apps such as Blogs, Comments, Documents and Media, Knowledge Base, Message Boards, Web Content, and Wiki. [These can appear as stacked stars, stars, and thumbs ups.](./site-content-configurations/configuring-content-rating-type.md).

## Managing Content Sharing Across Sites

Child sites can display content from parent sites, including web content structures, templates, document types, vocabularies and categories, application display templates, and data definitions. [You can configure content sharing settings at both the instance and site scope.](./site-content-configurations/managing-content-sharing-across-sites.md).

## Configuring Geolocation for Assets

Liferay can display geolocations for documents, web content articles, DDL records, and more. You can [configure geolocation settings for assets](./site-content-configurations/configuring-geolocation-for-assets.md), including selecting maps API providers and providing API keys.

## Securing Site Documents Content

By default, your site's Documents and Media files and folders are not visible in the web server directory index. You can, however, [enable this setting to allow browsing of documents and more](./site-content-configurations/securing-site-documents-content.md).
