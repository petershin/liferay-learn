# Copying Folders and Documents

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 2024.Q1`

With Documents and Media, you can copy folders, files, and shortcuts between [sites](../../../site-building/sites.md) and connected [asset libraries](../../asset-libraries.md). This can accelerate projects by quickly duplicating structures across contexts.

Before copying your content, ensure the destination site or asset library has access to the copied files' tags, categories, or custom [document types](./managing-metadata/defining-document-types.md). Otherwise, tags and categories are removed, and Liferay uses the Basic Document type.

!!! note
    File metadata and related entities (e.g., comments and subscriptions) are not copied. To copy documents with their related entities, you must use the site's [export/import](../../../site-building/sites/exporting-importing-site-pages-and-content.md) feature.

Copying content within Documents and Media requires specific permissions: View permissions in the origin site or asset library and Add permissions in the destination.

See [Documents and Media Permissions Reference](../publishing-and-sharing/managing-document-access/documents-and-media-permissions-reference.md#documents) for more information.

## Copying Between Sites and Asset Libraries

1. Navigate to the desired folder in the Documents and Media application.

1. To copy a single folder, file, or shortcut, click its *Actions* (![Actions Button](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Copy To*.

   ![Use the Copy To action to copy one folder or document.](./copying-folders-and-documents/images/01.png)

   To copy in bulk, select multiple items and click *Copy To* in the document management toolbar.

   ![You can also select and copy multiple folders and documents.](./copying-folders-and-documents/images/02.png)

1. Determine a destination for the copied items. This destination can be any site or connected asset library that you can access.

   ![After selecting the items, determine a destination for them.](./copying-folders-and-documents/images/03.png)

1. Click *Copy* to execute the operation.

## Setting Copy Size Limit

Depending on the size of the files, copying can be resource intensive. You can reduce the impact on system resources by setting a size limit for copy operations.

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), go to the *Control Panel* tab, and click *System Settings* or *Instance Settings*.

1. Go to *Documents and Media* &rarr; *File Size Limits*.

1. Enter a size limit for copy operations. The default value is `52428800` bytes.

   ![Enter a size limit for copy operations in bytes.](./copying-folders-and-documents/images/04.png)

1. Click *Save*.

Now copy operations cannot exceed the set limit.
