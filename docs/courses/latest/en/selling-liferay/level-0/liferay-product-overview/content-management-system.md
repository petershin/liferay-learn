# Content Management System

With Liferay’s Content Management System (CMS), practitioners can create, organize, and manage content for personalized digital experiences more efficiently, which simplifies the authoring and approval process for quicker go-to-market. Liferay includes tools for managing product information, promotion, pricing, and inventory which make it easy for your product managers and e-commerce teams to set up and manage single or multiple online storefronts.
