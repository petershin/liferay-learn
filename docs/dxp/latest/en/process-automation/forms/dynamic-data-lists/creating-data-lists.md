# Creating Data Lists

!!! important
    Dynamic Data Lists is deprecated as of Liferay DXP 7.3, and is planned for removal in 2024. It is replaced by [Objects](../../../liferay-development/objects.md). Please [migrate](./migrating-to-liferay-objects.md) your Dynamic Data Lists to Objects as soon as possible.

To create a data list:

1. Navigate to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Dynamic Data Lists*. 

1. Click the Add icon (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) to create a new list.

    Note, to add Dynamic Data Lists, you must have permission to access the Dynamic Data Lists app in Site Administration.

1. Give the list a name and a description.

    ![A form will open for you to create a new list.](./creating-data-lists/images/01.png)

1. Click the *Select* button under Data Definitions. A new form will open for you to select a Data Definition.

1. To use a workflow with this list, select it from the Workflow drop-down list.

1. To change the list’s default permissions, expand the form’s Permissions section and make your selections.

1. Click *Save* to finish creating the list. Your new list appears in the table.

## Creating List Records

By default, only administrators have permission to add records to a data list[^1]. To give other users this permission,

1. Navigate to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Dynamic Data Lists*.

1. Click the Actions icon (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the list you want to manage. Click *Permissions*. 

    ![Click permissions on the list you want to manage.](./creating-data-lists/images/02.png)

1. Select *Add Record* for the Roles that need permissions.  To give unauthenticated Users permission to add records select *Add Record* for Guest. Click *Save* to finish.

[^1]: Documents added in a DDL with the Documents and Media field type do not inherit the permissions of the DDL. Instead, the permissions are defined by the Documents and Media configuration for the uploaded Document. This means that Documents uploaded in a tightly restricted DDL can be more accessible than the DDL records.

New records can be added to a list from Site Administration or from a page that has the Dynamic Data Lists Display widget. See the section below for configuring this widget.

    Click the *Optional Configuration* tab for additional settings: 

    **Display Template:** Select a display template to utilize. Learn more at [Creating Display Templates](./creating-display-templates.md).

    **Form Template:** Select a form template to utilize. Learn more at [Creating Form Templates](./creating-form-templates.md)

    **Editable:** Whether users can add records to the widget’s list.

    **Form View:** Whether to display the Add Record form by default, instead of the List View. Note that even without this selected, users can still add records via the widget’s Add icon (Add).

    **Spreadsheet View:** Whether the List View displays each record in a row, with columns for the record attributes.

1. When finished with configuration, click *Save* .
