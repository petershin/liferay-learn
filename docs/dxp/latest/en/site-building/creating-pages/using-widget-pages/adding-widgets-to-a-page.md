# Adding Widgets to a Page

Widgets are applications. They can be simple and only used to [display content](../../displaying-content.md), or they can be full-featured collaboration applications, like the [Message Boards widget](../../../collaboration-and-social/message-boards.md).

```{note}
Widgets are rendered according to [render-weight](https://resources.learn.liferay.com/reference/latest/en/dxp/definitions/liferay-portlet-app_7_4_0.dtd.html#render-weight) on widget pages.
```

Follow these steps to add a widget to a widget page:

1. Navigate to the widget page and click *Add* (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) in the application bar.

   ![Click the add button in the application bar.](./adding-widgets-to-a-page/images/01.png)

1. Open the *Widgets* panel and search or browse through the categories of available widgets to find the one you want.

   ![The widgets panel contains several default widgets that you can use to add functionality to the page.](./adding-widgets-to-a-page/images/02.png)

1. Drag the widget to the column and row of the page layout where you want to place it.

```{tip}
In DXP 7.3+, you can click the eye icon at the top of any widget page to toggle the widget controls for all widgets. When disabled, the widget controls do not pop up when you hover your cursor over them.
```
