# Low-Code

Liferay’s Low-Code capabilities make it possible for non-developers to quickly and effectively build pages, modify look and feel, and create business applications, forms, and workflows without depending on developers to code, test, and deploy them. With Liferay’s low-code/no-code tools, business users can do process management activities (e.g., user input validation) and move data through visually-defined business processes.
