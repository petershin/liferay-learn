# Configuring Your GitHub Repository

Your Liferay Cloud onboarding email contains a link to a GitHub repository hosted in the `dxpcloud` organization. This repository is a template for a team's separate private Liferay Cloud development repository and is typically removed after 10 business days. Users must

1. Transfer the provisioned repository to their own private GitHub repository.

1. Integrate their private repository with the Jenkins (CI) service in Liferay Cloud using a Webhook.

!!! note
    If you are using an organization account, you must have administrative privileges to transfer the repository to the organization. The repository's administrators *are not necessarily the same* as your project's administrators in the Cloud console.

## Transferring the Repository

Follow these steps to transfer the provisioned repository to your own GitHub repository:

1. Create a new private GitHub repository.

1. Clone your provisioned `dxpcloud` repository locally.

1. Push the cloned repository from step two to the remote repository you created in step one.

If you need help creating, cloning, and pushing GitHub repositories, see [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com).

## Integrating with the Jenkins Service

Now you must integrate your new repository with the Jenkins service in Liferay Cloud. Set up a webhook in GitHub that pushes to the Jenkins service:

1. In GitHub, go to your repository's *Settings* page and select *Webhooks*.

1. Click *Add Webhook*. This opens the *Add webhook* form.

1. In the *Payload URL* field, add the domain of your Liferay Cloud `infra` environment's Jenkins service. For example, the URL of the `infra` environment's `ci` service for a project named `acme` is `https://ci-acme-infra.lfr.cloud/github-webhook/`. Note that the relative path `github-webhook` is required to integrate with the Jenkins GitHub plugin.

1. In the *Content type* selector menu, select *application/json*.

1. Leave the *Secret* field blank and ensure that *Enable SSL verification* is selected.

   ![Specify the payload URL and content type, and enable SSL verification.](./configuring-your-github-repository/images/01.png)

1. Under *Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?*, select *Let me select individual events*. A list of events then appears.

1. Select *Pushes* and *Pull Requests* from the list of events.

   ![You must select individual events for this webhook.](./configuring-your-github-repository/images/02.png)

   ![Select Pushes, and Pull Requests.](./configuring-your-github-repository/images/03.png)

1. Make sure *Active* is selected, then click *Add webhook*.

   ![Set the webhook to Active and finish creating it.](./configuring-your-github-repository/images/04.png)

### Setting Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in the Jenkins service to point to your new repository:

1. Log in to the Liferay Cloud Console and navigate to your Jenkins service in the `infra` environment.

1. Navigate to the *Environment Variables* tab.

1. Configure the following environment variables:

| Name                          | Value          |
| :---------------------------- | :------------- |
| `LCP_CI_SCM_PROVIDER`         | github         |
| `LCP_CI_SCM_REPOSITORY_OWNER` | [repo_owner]   |
| `LCP_CI_SCM_REPOSITORY_NAME`  | [repo_name]    |
| `LCP_CI_SCM_TOKEN`            | [access_token] |

For the `LCP_CI_SCM_TOKEN` value, use the personal access token created for your GitHub organization. For instructions on creating and accessing this token, see [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

The personal access token created must have all of the scope permissions under *repo* and *admin:repo_hook* checked. The *admin:repo_hook* scope permissions specifically can be removed later if you [disable automatic web hook management](#personal-access-token-usage) after your repository is successfully integrated with Liferay Cloud.

![Check the correct permissions to ensure that the PAT can be used successfully.](./configuring-your-github-repository/images/05.png)

!!! note
    If you are using an organization account with SAML single sign-on authentication, then you must take additional steps to authorize your access token. See [GitHub's official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) for more information.

After updating these environment variables, the Jenkins service restarts. Any pushed branches and pull requests in the new repository now trigger builds.

!!! note
    Jenkins versions before `2.222.1-3.2.0` use the environment variables `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead. To use the `LCP_CI_SCM_*` environment variables, ensure you are running Jenkins `2.222.1-3.2.0` or higher.

### Personal Access Token Usage

The personal access token referenced by the `LCP_CI_SCM_TOKEN` value is needed for Liferay Cloud to integrate with your repository.

!!! warning
    If the personal access token belongs to a personal user account and that user is removed from the organization, all builds fail to complete. Instead, use an account specifically belonging to the organization. See [GitHub's official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#considering-cross-repository-access) for more information.

By default, the GitHub organization's [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) must also have the `admin:repo_hook` permissions in order for the CI service to successfully integrate using the default web hook.

However, you should set the `LCP_CLI_SCM_MANAGE_HOOKS` [environment variable](../reference/defining-environment-variables.md) to `false` in your [CI service](../platform-services/continuous-integration.md). This disables automatic management of the web hook (which is no longer needed after you have finished setting up integration with your repository), and you can remove the (admin-level) `admin:repo_hook` permissions from the personal access token Liferay Cloud uses.

![You can remove the admin:repo_hook permissions from the personal access token if you disable automatic web hook management.](./configuring-your-github-repository/images/06.png)

Removing these permissions from the web hook improves security by minimizing access given to your repository.

## Verifying Builds

Pushed branches and pull requests trigger builds that you can see or deploy from the *Builds* tab in the Liferay Cloud Console. After setting up integration with the Jenkins service, a good next step is to verify these builds, to ensure that the integration was successful.

### Verifying Builds from Pushed Branches

Verify that new Git pushes trigger Jenkins builds:

1. Make a change to the repository (like adding a file), then commit it to the branch:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add file to test builds"
   ```

1. Push the branch up to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```

1. Navigate to the *Builds* page in the Liferay Cloud Console.

1. Verify that the build displays for the pushed branch on the *Builds* page.

### Verifying Builds from Pull Requests

Verify that new pull requests trigger Jenkins builds:

1. Create a pull request from any branch to the `develop` branch.

1. Verify that a new build is created for the pull request.

1. Navigate to the *Builds* page in the Liferay Cloud Console.

1. Click the links for the branch and commit in the appropriate build.

1. Verify that the links redirect to the correct GitHub pages.
