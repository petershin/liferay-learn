## Background

This module explains how to learn about Liferay’s competitors by using the competitor Battlecards.

The level 0 session on [Competitive Landscape and Liferay Positioning](../level-0/competitive-landscape-and-liferay-positioning.md) discussed Liferay positioning and the Competitive Landscape - looking at four categories of vendor that Liferay typically competes with and how to position for each of those.

This module introduces the Competitive Battlecards that have been produced for the main vendors in each of those categories, covering how they are built and maintained, along with where to find them and how they are structured.

The actual content of this module are the Battlecards themselves. In order to learn more about the competitors please download them and study them.

Further to that, anyone with additional information about a competitor can play a part and contribute that information to enhance the Battlecards further. Please provide feedback if there is critical information missing.

## Introduction to the Competitor Battlecards

Liferay’s Sales Enablement team uses a leading third party intelligence tool called Kompyte to scrape information of chosen competitors into one central location. This helps to create and update Battlecards with basic data relatively quickly and from public and generally reliable sources.

Additionally, feedback and information about competitors gathered internally and from partners is incorporated into the Battlecards.

The most critical source of these updates comes from sales people because of meetings with buyers, seeing competitors in opportunities, hearing feedback from colleagues, champions and the broader network.

Being vocal and providing that feedback internally or for partners through the CAMs is highly encouraged. This applies both when winning a deal over a competitor, and when losing to a competitor. In both circumstances most likely there was something in particular that either helped to win over a competitor, or that caused the deal to be lost.

New Battlecards are created throughout the year, with existing Battlecards updated on a Quarterly basis. The quarterly update information is located at the top of the Battlecard, and highlights anything new that the competitor has released or announced that may impact your conversations. 

## Where to Access Battlecards

How you can access the Battlecards varies depending on whether you are an Employee or a Partner.

* [Partners](https://partner.liferay.com/library?filters=15292668)
* [Employees](https://sales.liferay.com/en/group/library/competitive-intel)

Note that however the Battlecards are accessed, they are confidential and for internal and partner use only. They must not be distributed.
