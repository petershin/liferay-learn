# Payment Management

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay DXP 2024.Q1+/Portal 7.4 GA112+`

Using Liferay's new payment management application you can view online payments in detail and create refunds on them. To access this application, open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](./images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and navigate to *Commerce* &rarr; *Payments*. The Payments screen displays the following details about an online payment:

* ID
* Type
* ERC (External Reference Code)
* Date
* Amount
* Related To
* Related ID
* Status

See [Payments Reference](./payment-management/payments-reference.md) for more information on these fields. Only online payments appear on the Payments page. See [Refunds](./payment-management/refunds.md) to know more about creating refunds on these payments.
