# Managing Content in Content Pages For Liferay 7.3 and Earlier Versions

For Liferay DXP/Portal 7.3, you can review web content deployed using fragments and widgets in the Contents panel (![Contents](../../../../images/icon-list-ul.png)).

1. Edit or create a content page, master page template, page template, or display page template.

1. Open the *Contents* panel (![Contents panel](../../../../images/icon-list-ul.png)) in the sidebar.

  Content used on the page is listed here, along with how many pages it's used on.

  !!! note
      Web content that's displayed in an asset publisher with dynamic selection isn't listed in the contents panel. You must manage this content directly from the web content admin app in the control panel.

1. Open *Actions* (![Actions icon](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the listed content to manage it. These actions are available:

   - *Edit*: Edit the web content.
   - *Permissions*: Update the web content's permissions.
   - *View Usages*: See where the web content is used on the site.

## Adding Elements to Content Pages

There are some differences between Liferay 7.3 and current versions regarding adding elements to content pages. 

### Browser

In the Selection panel (![Selection](../../../images/icon-pages-tree.png)), you can view a hierarchical outline of all page elements, as well as select, configure, or remove those elements. Similarly, clicking any element on the page while in the design mode opens the Selection panel and highlights the selected page element in the hierarchy. When an element is selected, you can access its general, styles, and link options, if it has any. See [Configuring Fragments](../page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments/configuring-fragments.md) for more information.

!!! note
    A page's header and footer are not listed in the Selection panel hierarchy, because you can only modify them in the [master page template](../defining-headers-and-footers/master-page-templates.md).

### Contents

In the Contents panel (![Contents](../../../images/icon-list-ul.png)), you can view, edit, and manage all web content on the page. This includes content displayed in widgets and mapped to content fields. See [Managing Content in Content Pages](./managing-content-in-content-pages.md) for more information. -->
