## The Purpose of (Outbound) Prospecting

At a high level, outbound prospecting has these goals:

1. Introduce prospects into the sales cycle, ultimately to convert them to customers
1. Increase brand awareness and consideration
1. Support inbound marketing through
  1. Increasing organic traffic to the company website
  1. Using outbound contacts for ad re-targeting
  1. Defining the ideal customer profile (ICP)
  1. Improving go-to-market messaging

### Why do we do prospecting?

According to a recent study performed by [Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/effective-sales-prospecting-techniques-you-should-be-using#:~:text=Prospecting%20isn%27t%20easy%20%E2%80%94%20more,conversations%20and%20better%20win%20rates), over 40% of salespeople find prospecting to be the most challenging part of the sales process, so the natural question is, “Why do we do it?”

It is important to emphasize that hard does not mean impossible. Outbound is used by almost every SaaS and technology company to introduce prospects into the sales cycle and convert them into paying customers.

When outbound prospecting is done professionally with quality, it is an important tool to increase brand awareness in a positive way. This leads to more marketing lead generation. Outbound supports inbound marketing and vice versa. 

Even if a prospect would not say _yes_ immediately, likely some of these prospects end up browsing the Liferay website and in doing so increase organic traffic. Also, some prospects that are deemed not-so-hot can be added to various marketing driven re-targeting campaigns.

When prospecting is done well, it succeeds in turning potential and ideal prospective customers who were not looking for a Liferay offering into relevant contacts who might consider Liferay’s offerings in the future.

That is true prospecting, and that is why it is hard. 

It is important to note that budget will not have been allocated if the potential customer was not looking for an offering initially. In these cases initial approaches must be to senior individuals who can command budgets. In the case of Liferay offerings---depending on the market and also the size of the prospect company or organization---usually a Director or C-Level executive has access to funds.

Additionally, in many enterprises buying requires a large group of people to agree. It makes sense to start approaching several different individuals right from the start while remembering that the approach and message must resonate with the role.
