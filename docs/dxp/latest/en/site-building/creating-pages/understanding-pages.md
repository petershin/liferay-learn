# Understanding Pages

Pages render content and applications for users of a site.

## Page Sets

If you enable private pages, two [page sets](./page-settings/configuring-page-sets.md) are created: public pages and private pages.

!!! note
    For Liferay 7.4 U22+ and GA22+, private pages are disabled by default for new installations. See [Enabling Private Pages](#enabling-private-pages) if you want to enable them.

Public and private pages differ in the following ways:

| Behavior                                   | Public Pages | Private Pages |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----------- |-------------- |
| Visible to unauthenticated users           |   &#10004;   |               |
| Viewing requires login and site membership |              |    &#10004;   |
| Distinct URL pattern                       |   &#10004;   |    &#10004;   |

Public pages use the `[web-address]/`**web**`/[site-name]` URL pattern, while private pages use `[web-address]/`**group**`/[site-name]`.

## Page Types

There are several page types available when you [add a page](./adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md). The default page type is a content page. You can also create a page based on a [page template](./adding-pages/creating-a-page-template.md).

![You must select a page type when adding pages.](./understanding-pages/images/01.png)

!!! tip
    The currently viewed page's type appears at the top of the page to help you determine the administration options you have and where you need to go to configure the page.

### Content Pages

With content pages, users can build professional pages that can be managed easily and have their content edited in-line. Content pages are built primarily using [page fragments](./page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments.md) and widgets.

![Content pages can be composed of multiple fragments.](./understanding-pages/images/02.png)

Content pages have additional features and benefits:

- [Personalized and adaptive site experiences](../personalizing-site-experience.md)
- [A/B testing](../optimizing-sites/ab-testing/ab-testing.md)
- Approachable content and site building experience

See [Using Content Pages](./using-content-pages.md) for more information. To start building one, see [Adding Elements to Content Pages](./using-content-pages/adding-elements-to-content-pages.md).

### Widget Pages

A widget page has a set [layout](../creating-pages/page-settings/page-settings-ui-reference.md#page-layout) for displaying widgets (applications). Widgets can display content or add interactive and dynamic functionality to the page. See [Adding Widgets to a Page](./using-widget-pages/adding-widgets-to-a-page.md) for more information.

![Widget pages can provide a number of functions, such as a dedicated wiki page solution.](./understanding-pages/images/03.png)

### Content Pages and Widget Pages Compared

Content pages and widget pages differ in the following ways:

| Feature                         |  Content Pages | Widget Pages |
| :------------------------------ | :------------- |------------- |
| Ability to Add Widgets          |    &#10004;    |   &#10004;   |
| Personalized Site Experiences   |    &#10004;    |              |
| Access to A/B Testing           |    &#10004;    |              |
| Easy Layout and Content Editing |    &#10004;    |              |
| Advanced Custom Layouts         |                |   &#10004;   |
| User-Customizable Columns       |                |   &#10004;   |
| Staging Page Variations         |                |   &#10004;   |

### Other Page Types

There are other page types, each fulfilling particular use cases. See [Other Page Types](./understanding-pages/other-page-types.md) for more information.

## Global Page Templates

When adding a page, you can also choose a page template. Page templates are pre-set pages with applications already deployed to the page. Default templates are Global Templates, but your additional collections appear when you create them. 

| Global Page Template | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Search               | Creates a widget page containing Search Bar, Suggestions, Site Facet, Type Facet, Tag Facet, Category Facet, Folder Facet, User Facet, Modified Facet, Search Results and Search Options. |

See [Creating a Page Template](./adding-pages/creating-a-page-template.md) to learn more about page templates.

## Child Pages and Page Hierarchy

You can create a page hierarchy using child pages. Child pages are useful if you have multiple pages organized into categories.

![You can add a child page to a top-level page to organize pages hierarchically.](./understanding-pages/images/04.png)

!!! tip
    You can navigate among pages in a site hierarchy with the Site Map application. A site administrator can configure a root page and a display depth. The display depth of the site map application determines how many levels of nested pages to display.

## Enabling Private Pages

{bdg-secondary}`For Liferay 7.4 U22+ and GA22+`

By default, new Liferay installations include a release feature flag that prevents users from creating private pages. Follow these steps to enable private pages for your Liferay system:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) and go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *System Settings*.

1. Go to *Release Feature Flags*.

1. In the Disabled Features drop-down menu, select *Disable Private Pages*.

   ![Select disable private pages.](./understanding-pages/images/05.png)

1. Click *Save*.

   If you want to disable private pages again, deselect *Disable Private Pages* and click *Update*.
