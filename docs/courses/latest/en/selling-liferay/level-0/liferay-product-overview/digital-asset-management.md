# Digital Asset Management

Liferay DXP's Digital Asset Management (DAM) system can be used by your business teams to create, organize, and manage their digital assets more efficiently. You can administer and publish any asset in one central location, which can be utilized by your employees and customers to easily collaborate and share documents and media, and reduce the amount of time spent searching for those assets.
