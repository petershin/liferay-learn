* [Slimming Down Patched Installations](./advanced-patching-for-dxp-7-2/slimming-down-patched-installations.md) shows how to slim down a DXP installation by separating Patch Files from it.
* [Custom Code and Patch Compatibility](./advanced-patching-for-dxp-7-2/custom-code-and-patch-compatibility.md) explains how to maintain a DXP installation's compatibility with custom code you may be using to patch DXP.
