# Become a Publisher

To publish apps on the Marketplace, you must have a Liferay account with additional publisher permissions. It is free to become a publisher, but you must submit a form with relevant details on Liferay Marketplace. If you haven't created an account on Marketplace already, visit [Liferay Marketplace](https://marketplace.liferay.com), open the *Account* drop-down, and select [Create An Account](https://login.liferay.com/signin/register). 

Once created,

1. Go to [Liferay Marketplace](https://marketplace.liferay.com/) and scroll down to the footer.

1. Select *Become a Publisher*. A new page appears.

1. Click *Request Account*.

1. Fill in your first name, last name, phone number, email address, and enter a description. If you're requesting the account on behalf of a business, enter the business name.

1. Click *Continue*.

1. Verify the details in the confirmation page and click *Request Account*.

Once submitted, a Marketplace administrator reviews your application and makes a decision. If approved, you'll get an invitation to join your company's account as a publisher. If your company doesn't have an existing account, you're added as a publisher to a new account.

## Publisher Dashboard

After getting the approval for the publisher account, go to Marketplace and sign in. Open the Dashboard drop-down and select *Publisher*.

This page displays a list of your published apps. To publish an app, click *New App*. See [Publishing Apps in Marketplace](./publishing-apps-in-marketplace.md) for more information.
