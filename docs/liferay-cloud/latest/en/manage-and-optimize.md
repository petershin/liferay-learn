# Manage and Optimize

Liferay Cloud offers tools to help you better manage your project. You can invite members to your team and grant them different permissions with [roles](./manage-and-optimize/environment-teams-and-roles.md).

Liferay Cloud also offers plenty of tools to track and monitor your project's resouce usage. You can [view real-time data on each service's metrics](./manage-and-optimize/application-metrics.md), [receive alerts on unexpected behaviors](./manage-and-optimize/real-time-alerts.md), and [keep track of what other members of the team have been doing](./manage-and-optimize/team-activities.md).

To optimize the Liferay service's performance, Liferay Cloud has the option to [scale automatically](./manage-and-optimize/auto-scaling.md) to meet traffic demands while conserving resources.

These tools help you ensure your project runs efficiently within the [quotas](./manage-and-optimize/quotas-and-resource-usage.md) set by your subscription.
