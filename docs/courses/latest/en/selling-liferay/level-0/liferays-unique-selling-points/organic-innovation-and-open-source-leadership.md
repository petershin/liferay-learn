# Organic Innovation and Open Source Leadership

**At a Glance**

* Liferay is organically grown, not innovated through acquisition
* Liferay is an Open Source Leader with a Portal heritage

One of the most important facts is that Liferay has evolved organically using home grown technology. Liferay is

* Developed entirely in-house
* Committed to a consistent user experience
* Designed with consistent configuration and APIs

All of which leads to a lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

## USP : Home Grown Technology

There are many different aspects to Liferay’s offerings that support the overall value provided to Customers. One of the most important is the fact that Liferay has evolved organically using home grown technology.

### Built in-house

Everything in Liferay DXP was developed directly by Liferay engineers or contributed by Liferay community members and reviewed by Liferay engineers, ensuring that our technology is consistent and follows well-established patterns and coding conventions.

Most importantly this means that all parts of Liferay technology work together seamlessly. Products built through acquisition are much less likely to operate in this seamless fashion.

### Consistent User Experience

For our customers this means that both the user experience and the developer experience are consistent. As users move throughout the user interface, the features and functionality behave in a predictable way and the controls look familiar, which results in faster and easier user training.

### Consistent Configuration and APIs

For developers and IT professionals supporting Liferay, common patterns make configuration and APIs consistent and predictable. Learn one framework, and you've learned them all.

### Lower Total Cost of Ownership

These attributes make it easy for smaller teams to support Liferay solutions. They also lower the overall total cost of ownership, especially when compared to platforms grown through company or technology acquisition. These platforms often have inconsistent user experiences and technology landscapes.

## USP : Open Source Leadership

At the core of Liferay is our open source background. Liferay has consistently been one of the top companies contributing to open source. Liferay has benefited greatly from the contributions provided by our vibrant and active global user community.

Community contribution helps Liferay with

* Solving Issues
* Enhancing the platform
* Security

Open source collaboration extends and amplifies the capabilities of Liferay’s own employees.

### Power of Community

Early adopters in the community help our Product Team identify issues faster. Liferay's global community fuels ideas, helps identify issues faster, and amplifies the capabilities of Liferay employees. In addition, Liferay’s documentation is improved through community blog posts along with capability discussions in message boards.

### Enterprise-grade Open Source

Liferay’s documentation is improved through community blog posts along with capability discussions in message boards. Subscription services sold by Liferay for the free DXP software provide support and security enterprise customers need.

### Avoid Vendor Lock-in

Liferay DXP’s source code is publicly available. This provides greater transparency, security and autonomy to our customers compared to just taking our word that it is secure. Customers, or 3rd party experts employed by them, can examine the source code themselves and can be more confident than they could with a proprietary solution.
