# Content Management System

With Liferayâ€™s Content Management System (CMS), practitioners can create, organize, and manage content for personalized digital experiences more efficiently, which simplifies the authoring and approval process for quicker go-to-market. Liferay includes tools for managing product information, promotion, pricing, and inventory which make it easy for your product managers and e-commerce teams to set up and manage single or multiple online storefronts.
