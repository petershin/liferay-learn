# Sites

Sites include Design Systems and Experience Management capabilities, which work hand-in-hand, allowing designers to create the foundations of what site authors use to build sites and pages. With Design Systems, non-developer users can create the look and feel of Liferay Applications with little, or potentially no developer involvement. Meanwhile developers can extend the out-of-the-box capabilities which can then be used by non-developer users to further enhance the end-user experience.
