# Cloud

Liferay DXP can be deployed in 3 different ways: SaaS, PaaS, and Self-Hosted.

The Liferay SaaS offering empowers customers to focus on business processes and time-to-value while providing powerful customization capabilities. With Liferay PaaS, customers can directly manage their solution life cycle with built-in CI/CD, automated backups, monitoring, and alerts. Liferay Self-Hosted users have the flexibity to deploy into their chosen cloud-provider, with the understanding of the additional responsibilities that places on them.
