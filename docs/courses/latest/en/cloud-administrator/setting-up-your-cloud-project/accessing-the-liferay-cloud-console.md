# Accessing the Liferay Cloud Console

The Delectable Bonsai project has been provisioned, but Marcus and his staff must be granted access to it.

Here, you'll access the Liferay Cloud console so you can start working with your project.

## Accept the Project Invitation

When your project is provisioned, you receive an email from **liferay.cloud** inviting you to your project. Click *Accept Invite*.

The link takes you to the [Liferay Cloud console](https://console.liferay.cloud/). You must log in to accept the invitation. If you don't yet have an account, click *Sign up* and fill out the form.

Once you have signed in, the invitation is accepted and you have full access to the project. Logging into the console at any time (or going to https://console.liferay.cloud/projects) shows a list of all the environments you can access. 

```{note}
If your invitation was for a single environment (such as `dev` or `uat`) instead of the whole project, only that environment appears in the list. Accept the invitation for all environments to make sure you have access to all of them.
```

Take some time to navigate around the console to familiarize yourself with the available controls.

If your project is on Liferay SaaS, you also receive emails from **lxc.app** inviting you to set a password for your new administrator account on your Liferay instance. Accept this email as well so you can log in and manage your site.
