# Liferay PaaS Pricing

**At a Glance**

* Liferay provides three deployment approaches, all including Liferay DXP:
  * Liferay SaaS
  * Liferay PaaS
  * Liferay Self-Hosted
* Liferay PaaS uses an instance-based model
* Pre-packaged Bundles provides the most value
* A new pricing model for Liferay PaaS is under review

## Background

In the cases where, for a valid reason, Liferay SaaS offering is not appropriate for a prospect, but where Cloud is acceptable, Liferay PaaS could be the deployment option to offer.

With Liferay PaaS, Liferay provides DXP with all of its capabilities included, and as of DXP 7.4 that also includes Commerce and Analytics capabilities. Liferay also provides and manages the Infrastructure, and the Platform Services, but the Customer is still responsible for most other activities such as Upgrades, Updates, Patches, Security Hotfixes, Software Troubleshooting And Application Delivery.

## Liferay PaaS Pricing Summary

At the current time the price model for Liferay PaaS is instance based, with two primary approaches:

* A la carte
* Packaged Bundles

This price model is currently in the process of being reviewed with the objective of simplifying it, and to better align it with the new SaaS pricing model just discussed.

With this review under way, this module does not cover the a la carte options in detail, but does provide a short explanation of each of the Packaged Bundles available.

### Reasons for reviewing the pricing

We want to be making it easier for Liferay and Partner sellers to navigate between the various offerings from the pricing point of view in general. And in particular for Liferay PaaS pricing, make it easier to put together a correctly sized quote and “package” for a buyer.

Most importantly the buyer should also understand how their need is priced and what the elements are that impact it both short and long term. 

Before introducing a new pricing model for Liferay PaaS we are evaluating and examining what technically needs to change to have Liferay PaaS pricing aligned as much as possible with Liferay SaaS pricing. In particular this relates to potentially moving away from instance-based pricing.

### Bundles

The current price model has a substantial number of line items. The most complex approach is to use a fully-customizable model which requires selecting each individual line item to construct the configuration the buyer needs.

The alternative approach is to select from one of three pre-packaged bundles, and then to customize these and make them more robust by adding more items from the a la carte list.

When considering the bundles, be aware that:

* The bundles are available for the time-being, but they may not be continued with the planned revised pricing model.
* The bundles are discounted from the separate line items, and as such are offered only with 3-year multi-year commitment and customers must agree to be a reference customer.

If the customer cannot commit to a 3-year commitment and to be a reference, their option is to use the a la carte approach.

The three bundles available are:

* Liferay PaaS - Pro Solution Bundle
* Liferay PaaS - Business Solution Bundle
* Liferay PaaS - Enterprise Solution Bundle

## Liferay PaaS Pro Bundle

The smallest bundle available is the Pro Bundle, which is ideal for Small or Medium sized customers whose projects are less important and not mission critical.

This bundle includes the following environments:

* 1x Standard Availability Production
* 1x Standard Availability Non-production (i.e. Development, Test, UAT)

With any of the bundles it is possible to add further Capacity, additional Environments, Connectors, Enterprise Search as well as to buy Managed Services. Customers buying the Pro Bundle can also add Application Performance Monitoring, however it is worth noting that this is included in the Business and Enterprise Bundles at no extra charge.

Note for Partners in particular, without prior Liferay PaaS projects it is very important to include some SME from Liferay to guarantee a successful implementation.

## Liferay PaaS Business Bundle

The second bundle is much more capable for larger and/or mission critical applications. The Business Bundle builds on the Pro Bundle but adds high availability for Production and adds a high availability UAT environment. The complete list of included environments are:

* 1x High Availability Production
* 1x High Availability UAT
* 1x Standard Availability Non-production

In addition the Business Bundle includes application performance monitoring.

A basic Subject Matter Expertise package is included and the customer can choose either the Go-Live SME package or regular weekly SME guidance for 10 weeks.

Like the Pro Bundle, it is possible to add further Capacity, additional Environments, Connectors, Enterprise Search as well as to buy Managed Services.

## Liferay PaaS Enterprise Bundle

The third bundle is the Enterprise Bundle, which is designed for the most demanding Enterprise Customers and their most critical projects. It includes High Availability Production and UAT environments, a standard Non-Production environment for development.  It also adds a High Availability Disaster Recovery environment with cross-region disaster recovery:

* 1x High Availability Production
* 1x High Availability UAT
* 1x Standard Availability Non-production
* 1x High Availability Disaster Recovery

Like the Business Bundle, application performance monitoring and some Subject Matter Expertise is included, but the Enterprise Bundle includes 2 SME packages from a wider list of SME packages without extra cost.

As with all of the Bundles, it is possible to add further Capacity, additional Environments, Connectors, Enterprise Search as well as to buy Managed Services.  

## Summary

* The most cost-effective way for Customers to purchase Liferay PaaS is to buy one of the pre-packaged Bundles.
* The base-level Pro Bundle is the smallest bundle and represents Liferay’s recommendation for the smallest Liferay PaaS configuration.
* All bundles can be enhanced with any of the wide range of additional features available.
* Customers can, if they are unable to commit to a 3-year commitment and become a reference purchase from the a la carte list of products, but will not benefit from the discounts that the bundles provide.
