# Accelerators

Liferay Commerce Accelerators make building stores and exploring Liferay Commerce fast and easy. For steps on how to build your store from scratch, see [Creating Store Content](../creating-store-content.md).

Stores in Liferay Commerce are comprised of an interrelated hierarchy of components: Sites, Channels, Catalogs, Products, Pages, and Widgets. An Accelerator quickly and easily sets up a functional store by providing a pre-configured Site Template with a hierarchy of store components, a theme, pre-set store configurations, and sample data.

Liferay Commerce comes with Minium, a B2B site accelerator, out-of-the-box.

To use an Accelerator:

1. Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Sites* &rarr; *Sites*.

1. Click the Add (![Add](../images/icon-add.png)) button to add a new site.

1. Choose an Accelerator (Minium).

   ![Selecting a Site Template](./accelerators/images/01.png)

1. Enter a name: *Your Site*.

1. Click *Save*.

1. In the Site Menu click *Go to Site*.

Your accelerated site has been created.
