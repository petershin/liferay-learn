# Optimizing Sites

From having top-tier SEO, to understanding and acting on your site's content, to building a site that is accessible to all types of users, Liferay provides tools for identifying and addressing site issues.

## Search Engine Optimization

You can use Liferay's SEO tools to enhance your site's visibility in search engine results. Configure [HTML titles, meta tags, and canonical URLs, manage robots.txt files](./displaying-content/using-display-page-templates/configuring-seo-and-open-graph-settings-for-display-page-templates.md), configure [XML sitemaps](./site-settings/managing-site-urls/configuring-xml-sitemaps.md), and integrate social media meta tags like [Open Graph](./site-settings/configuring-open-graph.md).

## Page Performance and Accessibility

Ensuring your site performs well and is accessible to all users is crucial. Liferay provides tools to analyze [content performance](../content-authoring-and-management/page-performance-and-accessibility/about-the-content-performance-tool.md), [content metrics](../content-authoring-and-management/page-performance-and-accessibility/analyze-content-metrics-using-content-performance-tool.md), [SEO and accessibility on pages](../content-authoring-and-management/page-performance-and-accessibility/analyze-seo-and-accessibility-on-pages.md), and [page performance](../content-authoring-and-management/page-performance-and-accessibility/about-the-page-audit-tool.md).

## A/B Testing

Using [A/B testing tools](./optimizing-sites/ab-testing.md), you can experiment with different versions of your web pages to determine which performs better. By setting up A/B tests, you can compare variations in content, design, and layout, and use data-driven insights to make informed decisions that enhance user experience and conversion rates.

## Building a Responsive Site

Liferay provides tools that make it easier to [build a responsive site](./optimizing-sites/building-a-responsive-site.md) that adapts to various devices and screen sizes. You can add more granular control to Liferay's default responsive design by [using the grid fragment in content pages](./optimizing-sites/building-a-responsive-site/building-responsive-layouts-with-the-grid-fragment.md). You can also use the [simulation panel](./optimizing-sites/building-a-responsive-site/using-the-simulation-panel.md) to ensure your site provides a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, improving engagement and satisfaction.
