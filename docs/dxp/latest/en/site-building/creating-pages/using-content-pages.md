# Using Content Pages

By default, Liferay DXP uses content pages, providing a convenient user interface for managing and editing page content and design. With content pages, you can use configurable drag-and-drop elements or develop custom elements to create the desired user experience.

Like other page types, content pages support [widgets](./using-content-pages/using-widgets-on-a-content-page.md) for dynamic functionality, such as blogs, wikis, and message boards. Content pages are primarily built using [page fragments](./page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments.md)â€”extensible, reusable elements with editable components like text, images, and links, which you can also map to available content. See [Default Fragments Reference](./page-fragments-and-widgets/using-fragments/default-fragments-reference.md) to learn more about DXP's out-of-the-box fragments, or [Developing Fragments](../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments.md) to learn how to create your own.

When editing content pages, changes are saved as a draft in the site builder. You can review, undo, or redo changes during your editing session, without affecting the live page. When ready, publish the changes immediately or enable a custom [workflow](../../process-automation/workflow/introduction-to-workflow.md) for review and approval. You can also collaborate by adding [comments](./using-content-pages/using-page-comments.md) to specific page elements.

With fragments and widgets, you can display web content, documents, and more, while managing content, including content mapped to page fields. See [Managing Content in Content Pages](./using-content-pages/managing-content-in-content-pages.md) for more information.

Create personalized [experiences](../personalizing-site-experience/experience-personalization/content-page-personalization.md) and manage localized translations to engage your target audience. Optimize the user experience with the responsive layout editor, which adapts page content, so you can view and configure how your page appears on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Adittionally, you can use [A/B Testing](../optimizing-sites/ab-testing/ab-testing.md) to create alternative versions of a content page, track visitor data (such as bounce rate and clicks), and analyze results to identify which version performs better.

See [Adding Elements to Content Pages](./using-content-pages/adding-elements-to-content-pages.md) to get started!
