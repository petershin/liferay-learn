# Enabling Automated Live Chat Systems

{bdg-secondary}`Liferay 7.4+`

Liferay now offers integration with several live support chat platforms. Enabling this integration adds a chat window to sites on your Liferay instance and can be used to enable improved support and site experience for your users.

## Enabling Click To Chat

1. Go to the *Global Menu* (![icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; *Control Panel* &rarr; *Instance Settings*.

   ![Go to Instance Settings under Control Panel.](./enabling-automated-live-chat-systems/images/02.png)

1. Under the *Content and Data* section, click *Click To Chat*.

   ![You can see Click To Chat's icon under Content and Data.](./enabling-automated-live-chat-systems/images/03.png)

1. To enable Click to Chat for your instance, switch the *Enable Click to Chat* toggle.

   ![Toggle the switch on to enable Click to Chat.](./enabling-automated-live-chat-systems/images/04.png)

1. Once enabled, you must select a [Site Settings](../site-settings.md) Strategy. Your Site Settings strategy determines how Click to Chat is enabled across sites that exist on a given [Liferay instance](../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/virtual-instances.md).

   ![Choose your Site Settings Strategy option.](./enabling-automated-live-chat-systems/images/05.png)

   **Always Inherit**: Click To Chat is enabled for all sites on the instance and ignores configurations made in Site Settings.

   **Always Override**: Configuration for Click to Chat configured in Site Settings always takes priority over configurations made in Instance Settings.

   **Inherit or Override**: Sites inherit configuration from Instance Settings, unless configured otherwise in the site's Site Settings.

1. Select your chat provider and enter the [Account ID or token](#getting-the-chat-provider-account-id-or-token) given to you by your Chat Provider.

   ![Select the chat provider you wish to use. ](./enabling-automated-live-chat-systems/images/06.png)

1. (Optional) Click the *Guest Users Allowed* toggle to enable guest users (unauthenticated users) to have access to the Click to Chat feature for your sites.

1. Click *Save*.

Click To Chat integration with your live chat provider is now configured.

## Getting The Chat Provider Account ID or Token

Each provider requires a two step process to enable the feature:

1. Find your Account ID.

1. Copy and paste it into the Chat Provider Account ID field.

   !!! note
       Unlike *Zendesk Web Widgets Classic*, *Zendesk Web Widgets* requires an Key ID and a Secret Key.

You can grab keys from these supported providers:
