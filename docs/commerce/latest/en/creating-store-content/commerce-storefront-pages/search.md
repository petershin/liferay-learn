# Search

You can use the Search page to find content available on a Liferay site. This can be web content, knowledge base articles, documents, images, products, etc. The Search page contains a search bar and several facet widgets that you can use to refine your searches.

If using the [Minium Accelerator](../../starting-a-store/using-the-minium-accelerator-to-jump-start-your-b2b-store.md), the Search page contains the _Search Bar_, _Search Options_, _Search Results_, _Type Facet_, _Tag_, _Category_, _Site_, _Folder_, _User_, and the _Modified Facet_ widgets.

```{note}
The *Search Results* widget supports Liferay's Adaptive Media out-of-the-box. See [Serving Device and Screen Optimized Media](https://learn.liferay.com/w/dxp/content-authoring-and-management/documents-and-media/publishing-and-sharing/serving-device-and-screen-optimized-media) for more information.
```

```{note}
The Search Bar widget is scoped to include *Everything*. This is necessary for displaying Products, since Products are created in Catalogs at the global level and are not Site-scoped. 

Also, the Search Options widget is set to *Allow Empty Searches*. This allows customers to browse and filter all content visible to the Channel.
