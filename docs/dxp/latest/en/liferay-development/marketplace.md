# Marketplace

Liferay's new Marketplace is a platform where you find, download, and share apps. It comes with a revamped UI and also supports Liferay SaaS. To access the new Marketplace, go to [marketplace.liferay.com](https://marketplace.liferay.com/).

To start using Marketplace, sign up for a Liferay account, or sign in to your existing account. There are three entities you can publish on the Marketplace.

* DXP Apps
* Cloud Apps
* Solutions (for existing partners only)

To publish apps and solutions on the Marketplace, you must [become a publisher](./marketplace/become-a-publisher.md). Once you're a publisher, see [Publishing Apps in Marketplace](./marketplace/publishing-apps-in-marketplace.md) and [Publishing Solutions in Marketplace](./marketplace/publishing-solutions-in-marketplace.md) for more information.
